Stayed a few nights","From the moment we stepped into Katie's place we felt right at home! The place smelled and looked amazing! The bed is quite comfortable and the fireplace makes the room cozier. The room is bigger than we realized, which was amazing! There is another room where my husband was able to read in the husband and not disturb me while I slept. The kitchen amenities were perfect and made our 4 day stay pleasant. Our plans changed last minute and Katie was accommodating in allowing us to have a very late check-out. Highly recommend this AirBnB and will stay here again for our next visit to Rochester if necessary!"

Some highway noise during the day
The place is nicely maintained
The space is adequate for 2 people
We stayed one night
The bathroom was clean and functional but small.

Stayed with kids",My 5 year old and I had great stay. My only recommendation would be to bring your own quarters for the laundry. Quarters were to be on the dryer for use in washer (to make free laundry); however I did 3 loads and no quarters available so did use my own. Thanks again!

Stayed over a week","Best AirBnB I've ever stayed in by far!!
Spent almost 4 months at this amazing place for work at Mayo, and it was as comfortable as any place I've ever stayed.
Inside is extremely cozy with a lovely fireplace and plenty of place for your stuff.
The hosts Katie and Fred are wonderful, extremely accommodating and responsive to any of your requests, regularly provide free coffee and a once a month cleaning if you are here for longer stays, and always went above and beyond to make my stay In Rochester for work amazing.
There is probably plenty of great stuff about this place I forgot to mention, and it's because my long experience here was so exceptionally great overall.
If I'm ever back in Rochester, I would immediately look to see if this awesome place is available to stay in again!
Warm regards,
Roland"

Stayed a few nights","My husband & I stayed at Katie’s home for a week while visiting Mayo Clinic. This location was wonderful because it was about 6 minutes from Mayo. It was extremely close to shopping & restaurants as well which was very convenient. A Mall, Trader Joe’s & Chick-fil-A where also very close.
The home was very clean. The kitchen was great! Everything was new or updated. You could tell Katie has put a lot of care into this space. The reason I gave it 3 out of 5 stars is because I feel the 2 doors leading into this space could have more secure locks. As a woman, this is something I pay attention to at homes. Also, the bathroom situation I feel should have been described better in the listing. The bathroom does not have much privacy. One of the walls is glass and there is a sliding barn door that doesn’t actually close. So it can be very uncomfortable if you are potty shy. That was a big bummer for me.
Over all this space was very well put together, clean and close to a lot of things."

Stayed a few nights","As a medical traveler, this was a perfect spot to start out and get a Lay of the land. Air conditioning works great after hazy, warm days and walks. A quick 15ish minute walk to St Mary’s- and if need to go downtown locations, you can catch the intercampus shuttle or different buses. Even though close to highway, you don’t hear traffic when inside. Well stocked and clean! Would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","I have nothing but wonderful things to say about Katie and her place. We arrived about an hour earlier than expected and Katie let us drop our things off early. We were in Rochester visiting friends so we weren't at the B&B very much. It was so nice, after a long day with our friends, to come into a clean, cozy place to unwind and sleep. The bed was very comfortable. Would definitely recommend Katie's place! We hope to stay there again sometime, if we are in the area!"

Stayed over a week","This place is great! It's really nicely decorated and cozy. The fireplace is amazing.
She left many kitchen and bathroom amenities (and a toothbrush, advil to top) for me. Many towels and bed linens.
The place is calm and the neighbourhood is really nice. Walkable to St Mary's. If you are going to downtown Mayo and don't want to walk (not a lot of walking, around 20 blocks) you can trait the shuttle that goes every 30 min.
Shopping center 15 min walking. In fact, I didn't rent a car.
I hope to be coming back to mayo in 2025, the first thing I'll do is book this place.
There is no other place so aesthetically pleasing for that price in rochester, in my opinion. Even more expensive place were not as nice."

The space is cozy, located on the bottom level of a large house with its own entrance. And the fireplace is nice. The rental is tucked away, but it is also located next to the freeway, so you will hear the traffic noise. All in all, her little place feels like a warm hug."

Stayed a few nights","Katie's place was immaculate, beautiful, and well-appointed -- it exceeded what I expected from the description! I was visiting the Mayo Clinic during the freezing ""bomb cyclone"" and this semi-basement apartment was extremely cozy and elegant at the same time, with every amenity I could ever need, and a warm gas fireplace. If it hadn't been so cold it would have been walkable to town too. Katie was wonderful to work with as well -- super responsive, thoughtful, and helpful. I felt so lucky to have stayed in this ""rare find."" I'd highly recommend it, and hope to stay again on future visits.
Katie's driving directions are important! I used Ubers and taxis to get around, and some GPS providers don't seem to be aware that the street the apartment is on is one-way, so you have to tell them."

Stayed a few nights","I cannot rave enough about Katie's place. It was utterly charming! The pictures do not do it justice. We were in Rochester before the holidays to help house hunt. Consequently, we were all over town as well as at the hospital and downtown. It was the perfect location and the best place to decompress afterwards. Everything was sparkling clean with a eye to detail that meant we never needed anything. In addition, the fireplace and décor created the most cozy and inviting space. Katie was a great host! She was extremely responsive to any questions we had. We would definitely stay here again and not only highly recommend her property but have already mentioned it to others coming to the area."

Stayed over a week","Katie was so friendly and accommodating. The only time I needed something, she responded very quickly. The house was perfect for our 3+ week trip to the Mayo Clinic, and if it hadn't been so cold, we could have walked there in 10-15 minutes, as it's about 7/10 of a mile from the St. Mary's campus. The kitchen was adequately stocked with plates, utensils, cookware, bakeware, etc., coffee supplies, paper towels, trash bags, and a few basic seasonings. The bedroom was comfortable and clean. The bathroom has an unusual design, but we got used to it...a sliding barn door will only cover the toilet area or the shower area, but not both, so there's not a lot of privacy. We adjusted by one person staying out of sight while the other used that part of the apartment. I would recommend this apartment and Katie!"

Stayed about a week","The place was lovely like the pictures shown. The description was very clear (be sure to look at all the specifics). The host was kind, helpful and responsive to questions.
I didn’t end up staying even a night (planned for 10 days) because of a concern related to seeing a couple of bugs within a few hours - one crawled on my arm when I was laying in bed. It created stress that I didn’t need and unfortunately I ended up paying for two spaces to sleep (not getting fully refunded) while in MN because that wasn’t the right fit for me.
I personally didn’t want to wonder when the next bug may do it’s thing. Again for some it may be a non-issue but it was for me. I’m not sure if immediately anything could be done to resolve it yet. The host shared that the owner sprayed for bugs which resulted in my experience. It doesn’t seem to be one that was shared previously so perhaps I was the “lucky” one."

When we had an appointment canceled at the last minute at the Mayo Clinic, she was kind enough to adjust our reservation to reflect a shorter stay. As a host, she has thought of everything a traveler might need in terms of kitchen and bathroom essentials while providing a relaxing space to unwind after a long day. Her space reflects attention to cleanliness and organization as well. We hope her space is available in the future when we return to Rochester."

Stayed a few nights","Great things about this place: Katie was very a gracious host and responded quickly to any questions or concerns. The apartment was very clean , cozy and well equipped. The bed was very comfortable. It was close to grocery store and St, Mary’s and was a short drive to Mayo Clinic. There are bike and walking trails near by and it felt very safe.
The only down side was the shower is very small, no hooks in the bathroom and the washer and dryer are in the garage. This would not keep me from staying at Katie’s, but if these things are important to you it is good to know in advance."

First, it is clean and comfortable place to stay. Second, the various Mayo facilities are easily assessable. Third, it is conveniently located as far as going to restaurants. Fourth, it is in a nice neighborhood to walk (in our case we walk our dog). And fifth, and perhaps most important, Yinhui allows dogs and her place includes a kennel so we don't have to bring ours with use.
Overall, a great place to stay. And hopefully it will be available when we visit next year."

The house is very residential and my daughter and I walked from the house all over Rochester- we checked out Mayo Clinic, downtown Rochester, and many of the parks. Plus the walking/biking trail was almost right outside our front door.
Inside the house was clean and comfortable. Everything was well labeled and many extras were available. The couple of K-cups and snacks were a god-send after an 11 hour drive.
The owners were very accommodating and communicative. It was a great stay all-round."

The pros are the home was as-described with comfortable beds and it was close to several restaurants and local shops. Charming little house and Yinghui was very communicative and helpful. I appreciated our check-in and checkout was swift, it was very smooth to get in and out of the home.
Some cons were the floor boards were very squeaky so getting up in the middle of the night woke up our dog every time. The XL dog kennel was not as large as I had hoped, it did fit our dog but would be a better fit for medium-small dogs. We were very excited about the fenced-in backyard, however we were disappointed the fencing was only waist-high in some areas, easily jumped over by our 50 lb aussie-mix, so she could'nt be off-leash like we had hoped.
In all, a nice and comfortable stay for the weekend. We would book here again!"

Stayed with a pet",We loved our stay! I wish we could've stayed longer! Everything was clean and quiet. My toddler locked us out of the bathroom at 7 at night and they came right over and fixed it. There were snacks and plenty of coffee that made us feel well cared for. My 3 yr old and 18 month old loved the kids room and slept great in it. The 15min walk to field of fun was nice and being only 5min from St Mary's made it perfect. Having the fenced space in the back and the dog crate and the option to bring our dog made it feel so like home! There were fresh flowers all over and the house itself has been updated beautifully. The hosts were super attentive and very responsive to messages. I would love to stay again.

The XL kennel was perfect for my lab mix and we brought a smaller kennel along for our Shorkie. The walking trails along the Zumbro River were right across the street and worked perfectlyfor getting some exercise. We will definitely consider this home again next time we come to Rochester MN!

Very friendly neighborhood- met several other dog walkers on our trips around the block. The large dog crate was a great amenity for long stay days-better than the smaller one our dog travels in . Could have used a few more towels (one per person?)- we just bought a few more and took them home. Washer/dryer were convenient BUT washer does very small loads! Overall? Great place to stay! We’ll do it again- love having our critters with us and they love not being in a kennel."

This home was absolutely the cleanest place we have ever stayed. Every nook and cranny was spotless! And if there was something they didn’t have, I can’t imagine what it would be, except ice! Lol! The first thing I like to do after a long drive is make a nice cold drink, so a cpl of ice cube trays in the freezer wld be nice. Other than that, all we wld have needed to bring was clothes. Everything was at our fingertips! They had 3 different coffee makers and all kinds of coffee and my husband was thrilled. There were treats, which really hit the spot. We will definitely be back!! 🥰"

She went above and beyond to provide gluten free snacks for us and ran over some flashlights when a storm took out the power briefly. Communication was timely and efficient. The restaurant recommendations for gluten free menu options were on point.
The home is well-equipped and has all the comforts needed. The location is in close proximity to the Mayo Clinic, just a short 5 minute drive. My husband and our dog Callie took advantage of the walking trails that are just steps away from the house.
This is a gem and we will definitely be back in our future Mayo Clinic visits."

This is a rare find in the area that allows dogs and has a nice front yard and corner lot of grass for exercising them. I would highly recommend this property for your next trip to Rochester, MN."

I did not provide a perfect score for our stay due to the shower not appearing to be very clean. Overall, it was a great stay and no additional concerns of cleanliness in the house. Btw, some people mentioned cats while staying at Melissa's place in their review. If that concerns you, I wouldn't be too worried about it. Her residence does not smell like cats and quite frankly you barely if at all come in contact with a cat. If you do hope to see the cat, then I wish you luck with finding them. ;)"

Stayed with kids","I highly recommend Blue Vista. Several family members from out of town stayed there while we were all visiting family in Rochester. The location is amazing, we all took advantage of the park and trail access just across the street for walks, and several of us used the bikes provided in the garage to explore the trail system along the rivers in Rochester. Morning coffee on the front porch overlooking the park and river was a great way to start every day. The house was clean and tidy, had everything we needed to be comfortable, and offered an excellent place for people to gather for meals and socializing. Tony was proactive and accommodating, knowing we had an infant in our party, and made sure we had what we needed, including a pack & play and other resources. The bedrooms had blackout curtains, so it was great for those who wanted to sleep in, even with early morning light of late spring (and for daytime naps for the infant)."

From the location, a single mile away from the main Mayo campus and across the street from a great park that both my kids loved, to the coziness and comfort of the house itself, we greatly enjoyed the bonus movie room upstairs, this house met and exceeded all of our needs. The bedding was warm and the mattresses comfortable, more than enough bathroom towels and washcloths were provided for our family of four, and the shampoo and body dispensers were a great touch. The large collection of board/card games and movies provided hours of fun. Also, the personalized welcome message and the snack station were great appreciated and enjoyed. All and all, this home made, what we worried would be a difficult trip, so very easy. We would stay at this place again in a heartbeat."

The unit was very clean, the beds were comfortable and the front porch looking out toward downtown Rochester was a lovely place to ""hang out"". We had the tiniest glitch in getting the correct security code to get in, but Tony answered promptly and it was a non-event. His responsiveness was impressive. We will stay here again, I'm sure!"

Stayed a few nights","Blue Vista is a great place to stay if you need to be in Rochester. The reviews from most if not all the people that have posted are positive and so is mine. The location is wonderful, with a walking trail along the water, families of ducks and geese with one's own private Duck Crossing in the front yard, a big front porch from which to watch the world go by and an easy walk to restaurants and the Mayo Clinic. Inside is casually chic, large, easy to live in, and with super amenities thoughtfully provided - for example, have you misplaced your reading glasses? Check the shelf where you will find a supply. Coloring books, games, generous TV with Netflix, a very thoughtful collection. The kitchen is easy to use and has what you'll need to cook. The car got to stay in the garage. Bazillions of towels. I recommend that you stay here while in Rochester. Note: stairs to get in and out of the house and the downstairs bathroom is a bit away from the downstairs bedroom; no issue if you are ambulatory."

The neighborhood is quiet, but within walking distance to downtown Mayo, many restaurants and right across the street from Mayo Park. The kitchen is well-stocked, the bathrooms are clean, and the beds/bedding are very cozy! Tony and Teresa are very attentive hosts. They are quick to respond to any communication, are very accommodating and seem to be able to anticipate our needs. All in all, everything I could possibly want from an AirBnB host! Many people come to the community of Rochester to seek medical care from the Mayo System, this can obviously be a stressful experience. It's incredibly comforting to know that at Blue Vista one can count on a safe, relaxing environment. Thank you Tony & Teresa!"

We were so surprised to see that they had a Christmas tree up which was so sweet, especially for our kids. Their home is literally right across a gorgeous park from the Mayo Clinic where our daughter was being treated. We ended up having to extend an extra week and were so thrilled that they could accommodate our longer stay.
Everything was so well appointed, from the Kitchen with spices and literally everything one could want to the well-stocked Baths and great linens on the beds. Everything was so comfortable and we will definitely be back some day. So happy to have found this incredible home and hosts, can't say enough good things about them and our experience."

I truly believe they are doing everything within their power to provide a sanctuary. Since we’re experiencing an early winter here in Minnesota it was nice to have such a cozy house. The furnace worked well and kept it plenty warm! Finally, the ducks and geese from across the street were around a little and they are so entertaining!"

Stayed with kids","Blue Vista is everything it claims to be and more! The entire house is so comfortable and stylish! The kitchen is well stocked! We cooked nearly every meal there and never lacked for utensils or cookware! The refrigerator has chilled water and an ice maker. The living room is very comfortable and there was plenty of space for the six of us. We enjoyed hanging out and watching Netflix and Hulu! Each of the bedrooms is roomy with very comfortable beds and bedding! The upstairs movie room was a hit with our kids! They loved being able to have their own space and play a game or choose a movie from Blue Vista’s extensive movie collection! Both bathrooms were very clean and it was so nice to have two of them! Actually the whole house was shockingly clean! We’ve stayed in many AirBnBs around the world and this was by far the cleanest!
We spent many afternoons sitting on the lovely patio at the back of the house. It has a table and several chairs and is shaded by a beautiful catalpa tree. The house also has a really great front porch overlooking a park. There are two rocking chairs and in the evenings we’d sit and watch the ducks from the park waddle over and pass through the yard for some unknown destination. This was a surprisingly entertaining and relaxing time.
Overall I would highly recommend Blue Vista! Tony was an excellent communicator, always responding within a minute or two. He and Teresa clearly take pride in this property and for that reason this is a great place to stay!"

The house reflected pride from its owners who made it a priority to accommodate every want and need we could have. From beginning to end, Tony & Teresa communicated promptly with us and made us feel special. The house was so comfortable. It made you not want to leave it, but at the same time there was plenty to do in the area so we ventured out every day to explore and be active. We had our bikes and kayaks with us, as well as strength training gear, so we were able to continue our active lifestyle just as we would do at home. And it was good that we did because the food that we had at the local restaurants that they recommended was amazing! We highly recommend Blue Vista if you plan to be in Rochester!"

Stayed with a pet","This was hands down the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. I didn’t have any issues getting in and our two dogs had plenty of space to roam around as well as an accessible yard and sidewalk to use. It felt private, but Brooke was really only a message away if we needed help. She was so easy to work with and a big reason we enjoyed our time. I highly recommend staying here!"

This house features a “wet” bathroom which is something I am not used to but I will recommend bringing some house slippers or sandals. The rooms were spacious and the living area was a great open floor concept! I bet the backyard is so great during the spring/summer time! Would definitely stay again and recommend Brooke!"

One thing to be aware of though is the lack of access to the thermostat. Brooke said she would adjust it anytime if I asked, but I was always okay with the temperature and didn't need to ask. However, if you're temperature sensitive, this is a point to think about."

Stayed about a week","Brooke's place did not dissapoint! It was just as pictured, easy to find, has its own designated parking and it is close to Mayo! Shops are a short drive and easy to get to from this location.
I was having surgery the day after we arrived so the first thing I did when I arrived was wipe down all commonly touched surfaces with a lysol wipe and there was not a speck of dust or dirt on anything! It was very clean!
The kitchen was nicely stocked. The bathroom had more than enough supplies to last us our 9 day stay. We didnt need to purchase anything additional for our comfort or needs.
The beds were comfortable for both me and my husband. Normally beds, not my own, hurt my back but I was comfortable and slept very well.
The shower is a unique space as described. It was weird at first showering in an open space but it ended up being something we didnt know we needed!! I needed help to shower post surgery and the open shower allowed for that to be easily accomplished!
Brooke was top notch on communication and very responsive! She checked in during our stay to make sure we had everything we needed. We asked for a broom to sweep up some crumbs and before I saw the email response, the broom was at our door.
After check out, Brooke messaged me to let us know we left something behind and kindly offered to mail it. Luckily, we were still in Rochester and was able to go back and pick it up!
I highly recommend! Brooke is a great host and she will make your stay perfect and stress free. We will definitely stay here again for any future stays in Rochester!"

Our 2 year old loved all the space to run around like crazy, though we otherwise only used a fraction of the space. Most of the amenities one would need at a home home were available and the house was exceptionally clean. The location is in a nice neighborhood that backs up to a big forested area, and the drive to wherever in Rochester takes only 10-15 minutes at most. The price for us was outstanding given al that comes with the house. Becca was a good host and easy to communicate with, following up just after we arrived and just before we left.

Beds were very comfy and overall the house was a very nice set up. Some of the furniture was a bit dated, but all comfy and did the trick for what we needed! Rebecka is an amazing host, went way above and beyond in being responsive to a couple of minor issues we had and was so kind. She also allowed us to stay an extra day when our treatment at Mayo was extended. The house is very convenient to Mayo, straight shot down a main road and maybe a 7 min drive.

Stayed with a pet","Our purpose for our visit to Rochester was to see family and friends. It was just my husband and I as well as our dog. Allowing pets was a plus for us and one of the main reasons we chose this property. Overall, the house met our needs - it had space to sprawl out and work remotely (if you needed to), a garage to park our vehicle in each night and was VERY clean. It is evident that Rebecka gives a lot of thought and care to ensure her guests have a nice stay. All the basics were taken care of - from extra toiletries, towels, kitchen supplies, cleaning supplies, plenty of seating and easy check-in/check-out with a personalized note/instructions upon arrival.
The location of this property is on a corner lot, which faces the main street/through-way in this neighborhood. While not very busy, it has somewhat limited privacy from that aspect. However, the backside of the house is lined with a wooded area - which offered the opposite. Good privacy and if you are lucky, like we were, you will see deer walk through the backyard to graze each evening. We also took advantage of many walks in this neighborhood, which was quiet and safe.
The main floor of the house has ample windows for natural light and includes the kitchen, dining, living room, reading/sitting area, half bath and one additional bedroom/office that has a set of sliding doors with access to a small deck (which faces front or the main road). The finished basement level offers 3 bedrooms, including the master with en-suite bathroom, one additional full bath, the laundry room and a center living area and/or work area(s). The master bedroom is a good size and nicely appointed with a full en-suite bathroom (tub/shower combo), king-sized foam mattress (which we found to be comfortable), TV as well as walk-in closet, dresser and bookshelf for storage. We did not need the other bedrooms, but each seemed to have all the basics - closet, hangers, extra towels, laundry basket, TV, nightstands and/or dresser, but with smaller beds.
Overall, our stay was very nice. The house met our expectations, provided the accommodations we needed and was a good value.
Our thanks to Rebecka, for being a 'Super Host' - we appreciated your attention to detail and ensuring our visit was a good one!"

Stayed with a pet",Only about 10 minutes away from Mayo Clinic in a nice quiet neighborhood. There are nice large windows throughout the house so lots of natural light. The back of the house faces a wooded park so it felt very private. The beds are very comfortable but some of the furniture could be updated. No need to bring cleaning or paper products and there were some spices. Rebecka was a great host and very accommodating.

The beds were very comfortable and the neighborhood was so quiet that it was the perfect place for some R&R. The hosts have put a lot of thought in to what might be needed for a week stay, down to the umbrella in the front closet for those guests who forgot theirs. This was the perfect location for us to come and be able relax and to cook meals to enjoy with our parents who are in the area for a year for Mayo Clinic services. The hosts were very responsive and friendly. I would definitely stay here again."

Bella Retreat was everything we could have hoped for and more!!!! Having a large family we especially enjoyed the fabulous game room downstairs. The spacious kitchen and generous dining table ensured we could all enjoy the dinners we prepared. A highlight was all the amenities and extras we enjoyed throughout the house!! The weather prohibited us using the screened in porch but when we plan our next trip to Bella Retreat it will be in the summer season. Our entire family enjoyed our holiday in this fantastic Airbnb and will definitely be back!!!

Stayed about a week","This house is a great value, especially if you need 4 bedrooms. The location is great, right next to St. Mary's Hospital and close to the Mayo Clinic (1 mile walk). Beautiful neighborhood. Garage. You can tell the kitchen and bathrooms have been recently remodeled, with new appliances. The listing describes everything accurately and be sure to read it. The stairs are quite narrow and steep, and we found them difficult to navigate, especially at the top where the bannister ends. There is a ""stain"" policy mentioned in the listing, and that applies to towels (we found several of them stained which especially caused concern because the guests are asked to do the towel laundry upon departure and not the professional cleaners)."

It would definitely be a good place if you were coming for the hospital because it is so close. Also nice but not needed was the shared pantry of nonperishables.

We were able to walk to the Mayo building in 20 minutes. When it was raining, we walked across the alley and street to the Mary Brigh entrance of St. Mary’s and then took the free Mayo shuttle.
The house is in a charming neighborhood. We enjoyed walking around the block and we found a school with a fun playground about 3 blocks away. You are also within a block of a McDonald’s and KFC. Several other restaurants are also within walking distance.
The house had beautiful and comfortable furnishings. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook the food we brought.
The sleeping situation was great. We had 2 bedrooms on the first floor and 2 on the second floor, which was perfect for us.

My only feedback would be to let people know that when u come in the back door and it's dark or you haven't been there to watch your step because the steps to the basement are RIGHT there! We had our hands full and we're trying to get in the house in the dark and it could have been bad! A door or baby gate there would be helpful in my opinion. Overall my family was very happy with the entire space. Lots of room and all the things we needed were there! Would stay again if necessary.

Group trip","We were SO happy we decided to stay in this house for my surgery. Denise was far and away the best communicator of any AirBnb host I've stayed with. She was incredibly responsive to all of our needs and answered questions honestly and promptly.
The house is a very short walk to the St. Mary's campus--just as close as the hotels that are nearby--but allowed us to cook our own meals, have our own space and enjoy a lovely home. Highly recommend!"

Everything was well appointed with nice linens, towels, and anything else anyone could want. Something of note that made the house special was its feel and ambiance. After spending good but sometimes hectic days at the Mayo Clinic, it is nice to come back to a house that feels comforting and inviting, where everyone can relax and unwind. We would definitely stay here again and hope to do so whenever we might return."

Stayed over a week","There's a lot of room in this house!
The beds, sheets, pillows and blankets are very comfy - great quality!
It was very clean and nicely finished out.
Denise was quick to respond to any questions.
It is VERY close to Mayo's St Mary's campus and the shuttle stop where you can ride to the other Mayo campus - under 1/4 mile. Likely as close as the parkades and you don't need to pay for parking.
Emergency helicopter noise might be an issue for some - the helicopter landing pad for Mayo is about 300 yards away and there's frequent landings. Some fans are provided that provide good cover noise though they are quite loud."

Oven heats up fast so baking and roasting is quick. Joshua gave us a heads up when he came over to mow the grass. This was my first Airbnb stay, and it set the bar high.

Joshua was a wonderful host who provided everything we needed and more. Everything was functional and very clean. Our family enjoyed a very quiet and relaxing stay. Loved the private backyard to get some fresh air and even in the cold weather, a bit of sunshine. Great water pressure in the shower! I know many people put the water savers in… But then the shower takes twice as long so it’s a moot point. Better to have a nice hot, comforting shower that really helps aches and pains and does the wash and rinse job practically instead of sitting for 20 minutes trying to get soap out of your hair under a drip😂… just saying because we have been Airbnb’n it for 22 months now across the nation and we know a great Airbnb when we find it
…and this is definitely a great one! Super hosting, Joshua! Thank you so much!"

Stayed with a pet","""The Little House"" in Rochester hosted by Joshua, was the perfect size for myself & my fur baby. As always, the extra special touches around the house helped make it feel more ""homey"" & the stack washer/dryer would be perfect for extended stays. My fur baby appreciated the fenced in backyard & ran zoomies every morning to show it. Although we got along fine, Josh always reaches out to make sure our stay is problem-free. I highly recommend this house with Josh as host. I already told him I would be back next year!"

As always, my visit was great, and the stay was a great value and a pleasant experience. This is my favorite of all their properties, but they are all good places to stay while I’m visiting Mayo.

Stayed a few nights","We were in town visiting our friends and it was so nice having a small space to ourselves and we’re able to bring our dog with us. It even has a little fenced in back yard! Perfect for what we needed it for. The hosts even went out of their way to check in with us, very responsive if we needed anything. The house could use some updating but nothing that got in our way at all and we felt very comfortable. It was a great location for us and easy clear instructions. Much better than the previous hotel stays we’ve had."

Safe, quiet and private space for a solo female traveler needing an overnight stay while traveling for work.

My stay was overnight and only have two suggestions- there was no powder creamer or sugar for coffee and 2nd the wifi password was incorrect- it took me awhile to figure out the password was all lowercase and not uppercase how it was written on the welcome folder of information. The host was communicative and I appreciated that.

There was a nice bike trail to walk the dog on and also Silver Lake Nature Preserve was only about 5 blocks away, which was a nice walk. The fenced in yard was great to let the dog out in! The place was clean and the kitchen fairly well supplied! Would stay here again. Was not too far from Mayo but, not a reasonable walking distance. Well worth the money! We enjoyed our stay, as best one can when going to Mayo for tests and consultations!"

Stayed with a pet","Smaller than expected with back door in the bedroom with very little space to access the door. Kitchen has been updated. Bathroom has just enough room with a shower, toilet & sink. There is no counter space and the shower needs a good scrubbing and caulking. The living/dining room is a decent size with table/chairs and a futon not a sleeper couch as advertised. Thankfully we were not there much as the futon makes a terrible couch as in uncomfortable. The A/C is just a window unit in the front room (needs a bit of a cleaning) and this ""air conditioning"" does not make its way to the bedroom. We found a fan in the closet. The back yard is fenced (needs a bit of attention though) and there is a patio with table, chairs plus umbrella that is broke so not very usable. The yard itself could use a spruce up. Plenty of weeds and old brush piles left behind. So, all of this was okay but the one thing that was not okay was the very damp old house smell. Parking in driveway was a nice feature."

Stayed one night",What a wonderful spot. I needed a last-minute place to stay while traveling and this was a lucky find. It's a one-bedroom but it would be plenty big enough for 2-3 people because of the futon that can be used as a bed. In a quiet neighborhood close to plenty of shops and restaurants. Easy check-in/checkout and great communication from the owner.

If we’re ever in the area again, I will be booking The Little House for sure."

This place is clean, with all the same amenities you would expect at a hotel, with some cooking supplies to cook if you wish. Shower was great with good water pressure and nice hot water. Located in a nice quiet neighborhood, we loved sitting in backyard at night under the stars. It was very relaxing. If we are ever in Rochester again, I will look to see if this place is available to stay."

Stayed one night","This home was perfect for what I needed, a one night stay close to the college. Some things to expect:
The homes are close together so if the next door neighbors are outside, you can hear the noise but that is to be expected in the city.
The access to the backyard is through a door in the bedroom. Not that it matters, but I was just surprised to find a door there.
There isn’t a ceiling fan in the bedroom, not that I needed one, I just like the white noise of one.
There is a window AC unit in the living room, but I didn’t need to use it.
I stayed less than 24 hours but it had everything I needed to make my breakfast. I didn’t use the TV but they provide WiFi and you can use your own Netflix log in.
The home is older so expect that it does have some wear, but the home is cozy, nicely decorated, and I appreciated the personalized note on the whiteboard in the kitchen welcoming me to their home."

Stayed about a week","If you're looking for a home-away-from-home, this is the place. This house is in excellent condition in a peaceful and quiet neighborhood that's conveniently located a short drive from downtown Rochester, shopping, and restaurants. The two-car garage with provided garage remote is a wonderful perk, particularly in the middle of a Rochester winter. The kitchen is well-equipped, and the house has comfortable well lit spaces for dining, sitting around watching TV and just relaxing in general. It is a split level, but the stairs are wide half-flights with good railings, and everything you need is on the top floor, so if you can manage a half-flight of stairs except when you're coming or going, then the split-level should not be a problem. The layout of the house is excellent for a family of 4-6 with four bedrooms and three full bathrooms. A good dishwasher, clothes washer and dryer give you all the conveniences of home needed for comfortable longer stays. I highly recommend!"

Group trip","This was a very clean house with plenty of room for the 7 of us who spent the night. Checkin was very easy as was the checkout process. Grocery stores and other businesses were close by and we were able to get food delivery to the house that evening, which was nice.
If we had stayed more than one night we would have wanted some furniture in the downstairs main area so we could have had some more room to spread out. The only thing was a big screen TV with no place to sit. (Perhaps there is some remodeling going on we were unaware of). Anyway, that is why the house is rated a 4 star instead of 5 star.
The owner, Denise, seemed very nice in the email contacts I had with her and I’m sure would have been willing to help if we had had any problems. All in all, it was a nice place to stay.

The host was always reachable and willing to go the distance to help with any problems or to provide information.
We enjoyed our 4 day stay and would not hesitate to stay there again."

This home is ideally located and we really appreciated the attached garage with below zero windchill outside! It snowed on Saturday evening and we were completely plowed/shoveled out by Sunday morning. The beds were comfy and the empty downstairs family room was absolutely perfect for playing together. Denise is super responsive and a great host! We would definitely stay at St. Augustine’s Family Home again!"

Stayed with kids","I highly recommend a stay at Denise's place in Rochester! The location was ideal for us (two families with small children): within walking distance of a park, ~10 minutes to downtown, 20 minutes from Coop's Event Barn, and in a safe neighborhood. We loved the split level features that allowed each family to have its own space. One of the downstairs bedrooms had just a bed, which was perfect for a toddler needing a safe sleeping space. We also loved the playroom and appreciated the family-friendly amenities. Denise was communicative and hospitable, and even gave us early check-in so we could accommodate naps. Denise left check-out instructions on the fridge that we didn't see until we were leaving, but she emphasized that we should only complete them if we had time, since they weren't a part of the home's listing. Thanks, Denise, for the great stay and communication! We look forward to a return visit in the future."

My family was scheduled to attend my younger sisters wedding and so we booked this house for Thurs, Friday and Saturday nights. On the Monday just before we were to arrive, our 95 year old mother suddenly passed away. In a sudden flurry of activity to get back to Rochester, I called Denise to see if we could book Tuesday and Wednesday as well, and she was very accommodating.
Her hospitality and can-do attitude was greatly appreciated by myself and my brothers and we will be looking to stay at the same location in the future.

The kitchen and open living room was great as was the tv and office.

Stayed with kids","There is not a thing that was not thought of at this home. Everything was so clean and organized. We felt like we were in our own home! The toys for our three year old grandson were an added bonus. We could not have picked a better place to stay. As a matter of fact, we are thinking of buying an Airbnb and will model ours off of this one. It was unbelievable everything they thought of to have at this home. We did not want to leave. This is definitely one of the best there is. Would definitely stay here again!!!"

All the rooms are a great size and well laid out so we felt right at home. Thanks so much Nils!"

Stayed over a week","Great beds! Firm but not too firm! House is on a quiet residential street close to walking paths. Two-car garage connects to the lower level. We rarely used the front door. Well-equipped kitchen includes drip coffee maker AND a Keurig! The host even supplied the coffee! Large dining table was perfect for when the grandkids visited. Two large TVs, one upstairs so the adults could watch a movie while the kids played Nintendo (not supplied) downstairs. Plus TVs in two of the upstairs bedrooms. Great beds! A kingsize, a queen and a double plus a bunkbed in the lower level. Three bathrooms meant never having to wait! Master ensuite even has a Jacuzzi bathtub and separate shower! We visited in the winter so didn't use the large deck, barbeque and the big back yard. Had 15 inches of snow during our stay but Nikki, our host, made sure the driveway and sidewalks were clear before we woke up! She's a very attentive, caring host, quick to respond.

First, Nikki and Chad are excellent hosts. They were super responsive and did everything possible to make our stay enjoyable. Second, the house is clean, well-maintained, beautifully decorated, and very livable for a family of guests. All of my basics are covered: firm beds, strong water pressure for showers, essentials for cooking (including sharp knives, cookware, and other utensils). A two car garage to keep the cars warm in winter is really great. Additionally, the jacuzzi tub is a real plus. The location is perfect: close to a grocery store and a gas station, and fast and easy to get to Mayo, which was our reason for being here. This is now our “go-to” place for staying in Rochester in the future!"

The kitchen was pretty well stocked with most necessities, with ample room for seating. Having the garage to park a vehicle and bike was a secured feeling. The house is located in a quiet nice neighborhood. The location is close to the bike trails for walking and biking. An easy ten minute drive to St. Mary's hospital so very convenient to get back and forth. We had some nice November days and were able to utilize the back deck and grill and enjoy the beautiful fall views. Nikki was very quick to respond to a small detail with the furnace and get someone there ASAP to address the issue. Nikki was very accommodating with check in and check out times and dates.

Stayed a few nights","Exactly as advertised! Hard to believe something this nice, clean, and comfortable is available at this price point. But helpful since we were visiting the clinic. The master bath was so comfortable that it was tough to get up. Was so relaxing! Would stay again if we have to return, for sure."

Group trip","Great stay.
Everything as advertised.
Great location: 15 minutes to the easiest to use airport ever. 6 to 10 minutes to any location downtown, 1/2 mile from a very nice park/large green space. And is in a very pleasant, very quiet neighborhood.
Home is immaculate with nicely furnished common rooms. All beds very comfortable. Terrific private back yard with a large wooden deck.
Parking is in fact in the connected garage with transponder for the garage door.
We sent a few messages with questions on the Airbnb platform and always received helpful, nearly immediate replies.
No downside to this home"

The deck is a perfect place for breakfast and reading at the end of the day. The host provides information about Rochester and places to eat, and is very prompt at answering questions to make the stay stressless and pleasurable.
I would definitely return."

The host was outstanding and responsive-we needed to extend our stay by a night and we heard back from her almost immediately. There was a snow storm during our visit and she kept us up-to-date on snow removal.
If I need to return to Rochester, I hope this place is available!"

Stayed with kids","We loved staying at this comfortable and clean home during some medical appointments at Mayo. The beds were comfortable, the deck was sunny and there were plenty of cozy spots for our family to gather. We found a trail a few blocks away that led to the river — the neighborhood is quiet and welcoming. We are particularly grateful to Nikki for some flexibility we were afforded on our final day of the stay. We recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a peaceful home."

It was home away from home.
The house was very clean, and well furnished. We loved the backyard and the porch. Nikki was a super host, always available to answer questions. She even left candies for my kids for Halloween. The check - in was very smooth. We found everything we needed and more.
Everything about this house is great and we will be back again. 😀😀😀"

Tasteful decor, comfy beds, beautiful deck/backyard and super responsive hosts makes this one of the best Airbnb stays!

We would stay at this house again anytime. You can't go wrong with this house. It's so close to Mayo Clinic it only took us about 5 mins to get there, 10 if there was traffic, or red lights. The neighborhood was so quite and friendly. You really can't go wrong renting this house. If I could give more than the 5 stars I would."

Stayed a few nights","The house was set up perfectly for our stay. The house itself was very nice and well decorated. The owner left coffee and tea for us, a nice touch. The living room was perfect for gathering and everyone fought to sit on the comfiest chair ever! They had an inviting backyard that was another great place for our family to gather.
The beds were comfortable which is very important for us. The beds were also made with nice soft sheets.
Overall, the family voted that this was one of the top houses we’ve rented. We all loved it.
Another important point to mention is that the owner Nikki, responded to my many questions quickly and was very helpful. I highly recommend this property."
