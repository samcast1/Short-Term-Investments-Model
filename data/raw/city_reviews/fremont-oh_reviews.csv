Stayed with kids","Me and my family stayed at the Dillon house for a little weekend get away and it was absolutely beautiful! I got to live out my Victorian Era dreams and did not want to leave.
My kids also loved it and played for hours on the swing out front and spent a lot of time watching deer in the backyard. Would 100% stay again!"

Stayed with kids","My family of 7 enjoyed our time at Dillon House immensely! We enjoyed reading about the home's rich and carefully preserved history and finding old pictures displayed around the house. The decor, of course, is fabulous, just like the pictures, but is also comfortable and very functional. We felt right at home! And the hosts are very friendly, responsive, and helpful. I cannot say enough good things and we would definitely return!"

Stayed with kids","Our stay at this Victorian home was nothing short of enchanting. From the moment we stepped through the door, an ambiance of timeless elegance greeted us. My husband, who has a keen eye for architecture, remarked that this was the most exquisite Victorian home he has ever seen – and considering his experience, that's saying something!
The attention to detail throughout the home was truly exceptional. Every corner revealed another delightful surprise, whether it was the intricate woodwork, the ornate fixtures, or the tasteful furnishings. It was evident that every element had been carefully curated to evoke the charm of a bygone era while still offering modern comforts.
We found ourselves enchanted by the peaceful surroundings, and the proximity to President Hayes's house and museum only added to the allure of the area.
Overall, our experience surpassed all expectations. To anyone seeking a truly memorable stay in a picturesque setting, I wholeheartedly recommend this Victorian Gem!"

There was so much history in the home and it was literally like going on an adventure. I wish the weather could have been better so we could have gone outside to enjoy the patio and porch but sometimes Mother Nature is just not on your side. I would recommend this place to my peers.

Group trip","If you are even remotely considering staying at the Dillon House, do it!! It is absolutely stunning, especially if you like historic homes. My family asked if we could just buy it and move in! The house is huge with enough room for a large group. The kitchen is stocked with anything you could possibly need. The bedrooms are comfortable and quiet. The whole space is extremely clean. The neighborhood is adorable with a park directly across the street. The outdoor space is also beautiful. We had a baby deer visit! The home is about a 30 minute drive to Port Clinton and that general area but it's a nice drive. We go to Lake Erie every summer and have always stayed there but this is our new go to from now on."

Group trip","This beautiful home is perfect for family gatherings. We planned a day at Cedar Point (only a 45 minute drive) and the remainder of the 3 days we spent at the Dillon House. The outside porches, garden area, and fire pit were perfect depending on the time of the day. It was a great adventure just admiring all the decor in the home. The kitchen was well stocked with dishes (we didn’t cook any meals), but ate lots of take out food. The beds were very comfortable and the the bathrooms were also well stocked. The quiet evenings on the porch were so relaxing and even had deer visit the front yard. We highly recommend the Historic Dillon House."

We were delighted with the treats they left for us when we arrived.
Their communication was friendly and prompt.
The plants are lush and homey. The grounds are spectacular. I wish we would of had more time to enjoy the many sitting places both inside and out.
Feel honored to have stayed in such a beautiful piece of history."

Great location, while there we visited Ottawa National Wildlife Preserve. Checked out Seneca Caverns, cool cave tour. Castalia Quarry Metropark was a great hike to check out. Also kayaked at Ghoul Runnings, be sure to do the Haunted Hydro Tour as well there. Close to many restaurants and bars, we got to go from Jimmy G's BBQ and ate in at The Garrison, both were excellent. What a gem Fremont is!"

Our immediate (small) family was in town, sadly, for a funeral, and webwere able to be in one place all together during a difficult time. The full kitchen was a blessing, the house itself a point of entertainment and discovery for hours on end. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit at your beautiful home. The check-in process was flawless and we had no issues whatsoever. It was a blessing to have such a great experience when we had to focus on so many other details of a weekend filled with many events that required our attention. We definitely recommend to others. Thank you so much!!"

The owners have updated the home to tastfully blend in with the ambiance of days gone by. Michael and Christopher have clearly spent countless hours in collecting a vast variety of antiques and collectibles that fill the home. If you have a love and appreciation for antiques, you will LOVE this home. The grounds that surround the home are beautiful as well. My family felt like royalty staying at the Dillon House."

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful late 1800s craftsmanship. Ever tried hanging a door at home? What about using 1890s tools and hanging a 300# door on three hinges perfectly so it glides smoothly for the next 120 years. And if memory serves there are about a dozen on the first floor. Even the flathead screws holding them up are all in alignment.
Enjoy the decorations, the pictures and imagine haven lived in this home. Granted, there are modern amenities, microwave, dishwasher, but not in a disruptive way to the vibe of the house.
Take some time to sit in each room and just let your eyes and mind wander."

Joyce welcomed me in as soon as I pulled up, she is very hospitable, when Joyce was talking to it was like we two friends who reunited after 12 years, I had a issue the roku very late at night and Joyce took care of it. Paul is nice and helpful. The back yard is to hang out. One of the best parts of my stay is that the dogs made friends with me and kept me company. The dogs were either sitting on my lap, at my feet or put their heads on leg, definitely great host🐾. Joyce had plenty of coffee and water for me. There is a hot tub you can use and pool table. If you are allergic to cats or dogs, make sure you bring allergy pills. I had a great stay, I will be back."

The bed was very comfortable, and I got a great night's sleep. Joyce was so welcoming and hospitable that I felt right at home. She generously made me a delicious, full breakfast, which got me off to a great start on a long day of driving."

Stayed with a pet","Joyce and Paul were awesome hosts! I stayed here for 3 months with my dog and I felt right at home. The house was always clean, they respected my privacy, and they even treated my dog like one of their own. They made me breakfast, lunch, and dinner occasionally and some nights we would have a couple drinks and just hangout. The location is perfect and I was very surprised to find there’s lots to do in Fremont! There’s cute restaurants, plenty of fast food, a couple of vegetarian juice bars, and a Walmart all within 15 minutes. I definitely recommend staying here!"

Stayed one night",This place was perfect after a long day at Cedar Point. It was easy to find and very clean. Beds were super comfy for resting sore bodies after a day of riding coasters. My only suggestion to the host would to leave the front porch light on if you know guests will be arriving after dark. It was a little hard to see the house numbers and the key pad. Otherwise we will definitely stay here again on our next visit to the area.

In years past, we used the common hotels in Fremont. Knowing the unpredictable quality of those hotels, as soon as we saw this Airbnb option, we wanted to try it.
The rental was spotless and smelled fresh and clean upon entering. The location was in a nicely kept area of Fremont. We felt incredibly safe and comfortable. There were a few family games in the living room that my boys enjoyed, and there was a multi-function keurig for the coffee lovers like me. I forgot my hairdryer and was grateful to find one in the bathroom. The mattresses were pleasantly firm, with plenty of towels, and extra blankets in the closets.
The host was incredibly responsive and helpful every step. We will gladly book again at this location! Thank you for a wonderful stay in Fremont!!"

Everything was very clean and very spacious. My friends and I enjoyed the early morning with peaceful nature views out back. There's a little dock, and we got to see seagulls, a blue heron, a bald eagle, and lots of egrets. We definitely want to go back and spend more time with all the amenities. Totally recommend it!"

Marci’s Airbnb was a great location for us all to converge for our trip to Cedar Point. The kitchen was well equipped for making a dinner for a large group like we had. Sleeping areas upstairs were very comfortable and there were plenty of blankets around the house. We also enjoyed the outdoor space with the dock and volleyball net. One thing that stood out to me was Marci’s excellent communication. She made sure all our drivers had the parking and directional information they needed and she was always quick to respond. The check in process was also very smooth. I definitely recommend staying at Eagle Isle.

There is boat dock access to jump into the river if that’s your speed. We found Jimmy Bucketts bar which is walking distance down the road at the local campground. They have a snack shack there to buy food and drinks.
Go to Jimmy Bucketts! This place is a little hidden gem of a tiki bar.
Pack some K-cups since they don’t have a coffee pot. Hopefully we will be back!"

We were forced to leave at 9pm because we had 10 people even tho it’s states 11 by the police causing us to leave behind $100 in food and $300 in my belongings smh . Also this is false advertising we didn’t have the “entire townhouse” we are In one third of TWO peoples house spying on us and evading our privacy I do not recommend this space

Our group of 16 rented both sides at the same time. The place isn't specifically set up for this. You have to go outside and back in to move between the two, but it worked really well. On our final full day there, someone asked if the 4 kids in our group (ages 9-12) were clamoring for screen time. Nope - they hadn't asked for phones/tv/tablets once. What a delight!
The south wing was a bit more spacious for group gathering, while the north wing had slightly more comfortable sleeping accommodations. They're both great for their own reasons, though. Go north if you love ping pong :)"

Enjoyed the view of the Sandusly River. Grandkids loved playing hid and go seek in the house. There was only 6 of us. So we had more than enough space and beds. If you have a large family it would definitely be a better alternative to multiple hotel rooms. Marci is great to communicate any instructions needed to make your stay easy. Appreciated the family friendly home to stay in.

There is so much room in this house and it is so great for entertaining. The game room is heated and stocked with a tv, pool table, ping pong, foosball, and a number of games. There are folding tables, and plenty of chairs and where we spent most of the time. The bedrooms are updated and beds are super comfortable. We found air mattresses in the closet for use if there are more people staying than the number of beds. The location of the property was in a beautiful setting, and is only 40 minutes from Cedar Point! We also visited both Bowling Green University and Heildelberg University which was 45 minutes and 20 minutes away. This is a great place to stay if you are planning multiple college visits to these schools, or even Toledo University. The hosts were great and communicated by text, but everything was provided within the stay!"

They also provided things we didn’t ask for but actually needed and didn’t think to ask for like baby gates, high chair and excellent game room. It is far enough from town for quiet serenity yet close enough to town to get groceries. We will specifically ask for this place on our next trip to this area."

They made us feel so welcomed and made sure we had every thing we needed for a mini family reunion. The history of the home and area was so neat to learn about. The Lake Erie Islands and Cedar Point are also just a mere 40 minutes away. We will definitely be back and can’t wait for a return to The Octagon House!

Stayed with kids","One word, perfection. The house was amazing and definitely the most interesting home we've stayed in. The surroundings were beautiful and peaceful. We didn't get to use the outside porch swing because it was raining the only morning we had free, but that looked like a wonderful way to start out the day with a hot cup of coffee. Janet has amazing attention to detail, down to extra toothbrushes and toothpaste if you forgot yours. the kitchen was amply stocked with anything you would need to cook meals. The house was spotless. We didn't have time to go into the garage to play, but it looked like a lot of fun. We went a perfect time of year with the corn in the field just about knee high giving us the opportunity to watch the tops of the corn blow in the wind. Janet was an amazing host. She was communicative but not overbearing. We loved our stay, and if we are ever in the area again we would absolutely stay again."

Stayed with kids","Chose to rent for a working holiday, with some family along for the trip. More than enough space for 2 adults and a teen. All living spaces were comfortable, full kitchen with more than basics allowed for expanded menu, and games (electronic and board/pool table) left much to do with down time. Janet provided timely info before the trip which allowed easier packing and was up front with check in instructions before I needed them (which was appreciated). In cold weather during visit house held temp well and the fireplace(s) were a bonus for relaxed talking in the evenings. Looking forward to coming back during warmer weather, and enjoying grilling/spending more time in the designated outdoor areas. Wi-Fi was functional for email and general browsing, did not try to stream since large selection of movies available and brought some from home as well. Thank you for hosting, Janet!"

Stayed a few nights","Following a family visit I needed to quarantine before I could return home due to my wife’s medical condition. Janet took my situation to heart and made sure no one came to the house during my stay. Thank you so much!
It’s impossible to get bored in this house—it has so much character—but if you want quiet, just turn all media off and you have quiet. Everything is clean and a clever mix of tradition and modern.
Every part of the day has been thought out, anticipated and provided for, from morning coffee to placement of night lights. You are never far from tissues, coasters, or a USB charging port. I'd seriously like to know where Janet got the bath towels.
I loved the easy to use washer/dryer.

The garage had a pool table, a foosball table, and also a ping pong table which we all loved. The hosts were very thoughtful with everything that was provided. The only negatives any of us could think of was the wifi was spotty but that was not an issue since our data worked just fine. Best of all the price was amazing especially compared to Airbnb's in Sandusky. Highly recommend thank you for the great experience."

I appreciate being about to use the washer and dryer. Forest might have left out the picture book of Guilin for my enjoyment, a nice touch.

Property is clean and well-maintained. Can't recommend his place highly enough."

The entire apartment was very clean, comfortable and looked newly remodeled. We appreciated the feeling of safety in this nice neighborhood. It was super easy to find, and Forrest gave very clear instructions on how to get in via the private entrance. Just wish we'd had more time to enjoy the lovely, peaceful and charmingly designed backyard oasis! (Somebody has a very talented green thumb!!!) Communication with Forrest was timely, helpful and friendly! We would not hesitate to recommend this wonderful apartment!"

I had to drive in very late at night, and had to check-out early to continue my drive. I regret not being able to stay there for a few more days! The outside garden is beautiful and the pics aren't representative of the place. The actual place is actually a lot better than the airbnb pics. Definitely a great place to stay with a ton of amenities. I will be sure to stay here if I come to Ohio another time."

The backyard is beautiful & I really wish I would’ve had more time to enjoy it - this was the perfect space for what I needed to crash after a long day at Cedar Point. It’s on the way home (I’m from MI). The bathroom was spectacular, the decor was so relaxing, a beautiful piano, TV with Netflix but sooo many DVDs available if you’re feeling nostalgic. The bed was comfy. The hosts left snacks. The dinette was great for the space. There was a full laundry room if you needed it too! I’ve already booked a couple return visits! Can’t recommend Forrest’s & his wife’s space enough!!!"

Such a cozy comfy background with beautiful decorations that remind me of being a kid. If I had more than a night to spend at this place I would of loved spending it in the backyard. The inside also was amazing. Great comfy furniture as well as beautiful decor that gives you a cabin/American home feel. Loved the beautiful piano as well as the art in the bedroom. Amenities were as listed you’ve got a washer and dryer as well as a microwave, toaster oven, coffee maker, fridge/freezer, and TV with provided Netflix. Also the Forrest’s go out of their way to provide you with small things like toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner, plates, utensils, SNACKS :), and WATER :) SO SO IMPORTANT. Thank you for our wonderful stay!"

Stayed one night","This was our first Airbnb experience and it was just great. Our quarters were tidy and clean which is important to us. Our host was wonderful and supplied the information we needed to enjoy local restaurants. Everyone has different needs for a comfortable bed. This bed was a bit soft for our needs yet very well dressed with plenty of extra pillows and blankets. If you are interested in history there is a presidential library in Fremont (19th President of United States Rutherford B. Hayes 1877-1881 and civil war general). His family opened the first presidential public library in 1916. Also, Spiegel Grove, the nineteenth century estate of President Rutherford B. Hayes is in Fremont as a point of interest. Maybe we'll come back to see them in summer. The stromboli and cookies at Elroys deli in Fremont are very good."

No sink or cook top. Great for a night or two. If they could just add a sink and stove top it would be comfortable longer term.
But it’s a nice quiet very clean place in a safe residential neighborhood with a responsive host.
And the free laundry is en-suite and awesome."

Stayed one night","I booked Forrest’s air Bnb last minute on my way from Chicago to New York. It was easy to get to, easy parking, private, clean, comfortable and cozy. Even though I booked last minute, they still put up a “welcome Christina” sign in the mini kitchen. Very grateful to have found this place. It was safe and comfortable - a perfect place to unwind after being in the car for 8 hours.
The laundry was a nice bonus (I had to pack light for this trip). They were also very accommodating when I needed to check in later, and they reached out to make sure I was comfortable temperature wise.
I also ended up needing to hop on a work call at check out time—they had no issue with me checking out late so I could use the wifi instead of making the call from my car.
The amenities were exactly as described and what I needed - I’m very grateful Forrest could host me last minute!"

I tried to talk myself into taking the day off just to relax hide out. The space was very clean and neat. It's close to shopping areas but tucked away in a nice neighborhood. I work until 2a and I had no concerns about my safety coming in that late at night. I have already booked my next stay. Forrest is very accommodating and asked me several times if I was comfortable and if I needed anything. I have told my friends I could use it as a hide out, like a ""She Shed"" even though it's 3 hours from home. I highly recommend staying here!"

My friends and I were very impressed with the attention to detail. Two of us slept on the sofa bed in the living room and it was already made up when we arrived! It was so comfortable and looked so cozy. Forrest and Vickie go above and beyond to make their guests feel welcome!! I would definitely stay here again!"

The place is completely redone and everything is so nice, clean, new and modern. It was spotless and had everything we needed for our stay. The furniture and king sized beds were comfy (soft mattresses). Lots of nice, soft towels in the bathroom. There are so many windows so it's nice and bright, but there are room darkening curtains for sleeping. The location is super convenient to restaurants and Kroger (with a Starbucks inside) and parking is right outside the front door (with space for 2 cars if needed). We will definitely book again next time we visit family in Fremont!"

Feels remote while being very close to town in case you need to pick anything up. Jeanne was very responsive and easy to communicate with. Would happily stay here again and recommend to anyone considering it.

Stayed a few nights","We stayed six nights and could have stayed longer.
The unit is above the garage which makes it very private. It was very clean and furnished with all your needs in mind.
The grounds exceeded our expectations. Private sitting areas around the grounds and a fire pit for s’mores.
Our host was on site and made sure all our needs were met.
I would definitely go back again if in the area. You will not be disappointed

Stayed with kids","Honored to have been The Apartment’s first Airbnb guests! Quick and kind communication, extremely warm welcome from Jeanne and her family, and The Apartment is as clean and beautiful as it looks in the photos. Also well-stocked with everything you need. Gorgeous property abutting a nature preserve—my two kids under 5 loved running around in the yard after a long day in the car. We then watched a beautiful sunset from The Apartment’s big living room window. Hope to stay again on our next trip through!"

Stayed a few nights","Donald came and spoke to us personally which was super nice!! The price was very affordable, beautiful river behind the house, good parking, very clean, lots of towels, coffee was great, an amenity not listed is the toilet has a bidet which was amazing!!! The only complaint we have is that the stirs going up to the loft are rough on bare feet, due to them being a grate. But the stairs make the place feel more unique and rustic!! Right down the road is a delicious unique diner (speed trap diner). Over all we’ve had a wonderful stay here we highly recommend it!! 10/10!!"

Stayed one night","My wife wants our honeymoon there after 25 years without.
If you are looking for the Trump Tower, this isn't it. This is much more cozy and comfortable. You can get in the dual recliner and take a nap with the TV on. If you wake up too early, you can crawl into bed on the super comfortable mattress to finish the refreshing.
Perched high on the bank of the Portage River, it is not gold plated; but has it's own really cool patina.
The hosts have provided everything you need, from makeup removal pads to binoculars.
Think it's been too long since you renewed your undies? They have gadgets that will clean and dry them for you.
The list of provided ""make your self comfortable"" items in your home away from home is long.
The grounds around your temp abode are very natural and delightful. You may see :

Rabbit munching grass by the deck
Chipmunk running around wondering why you are watching him
Red headed woodpecker at the feeder.
YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED

Stayed a few nights","We were willing to make things work even w/ inaccurate description/photos of the area. It would be preferred that if you are familiar with the area, especially when living on a cliff overlooking water, it’s good to mention that several times.
It’s a nice space for an intimate stay w/a couple/small family. There’s well water which usually isn’t a problem if there’s water softener available. The smell from the water being turned on smelled like sewage, it made people sick. We left and even left our turkey in the home. The host blamed the smell on us and dubbed it “marijuana” even though I reached out and communicated with him the entire time about issues that rose.
We barely stayed 20 minutes total. The sliding back doors didn’t open either. We planned to stay a few days and when it didn’t happen, we asked for a refund and was denied-He was only willing to give us barely partial refund for the inconvenience even during thanksgiving! We won’t be back, but I hope the best for others!"

Kitchen table, stools and attached open shelf perfect easy storage & access to cereal, snacks and dry goods. Plenty of space to stash luggage, coolers & other gear so its accessible but out of the way. We took a 1.5 hour evening walk enjoyed the architecture, art & food festival downtown and view of river with lighted boats from bridge. Very pleasant, like living in Mayberry."

There were no surprises, and everything was just as advertized.
The unit is stylishly decorated with modern utilities. We had fun chatting with the kids playing on the street.
Pulling up to parking around back off the alley was extremely convenient. We love walking rails, and the nearby train tracks (not used as near as we could tell) cut through some really neat neighborhoods.
The address is super convenient for grocery etc. if you need, and--the tracks take you in a straight line there--a very easy walk home from the Depo or Chuds if you have a late night pizza or beer!
Definitely will be back!

Stayed a few nights",I loved staying in Jacob's home over the weekend with my family. The home was spotless. It was by far the cleanest Airbnb I have ever stayed at. All the bed linens were sealed in sanitized bags to provide an extra level of cleanliness. My husband and I slept on the pull out couch and it was very comfortable. Jacob was very thorough with communicating before our trip and even sent us a follow-up note after we left. This home was in a perfect location and had everything we needed for the week. If we are ever in the area again we will certainly make a point to stay at Jacob's.

Stayed one night","We had a wonderful time staying at this airbnb! In fact, it was probably the best one I've ever stayed at. My husband and I, along with our 2 kids (1.5 & 3.5) stayed in the Everly King Suite and it was great. The small bed was perfect for my 3.5 year old and we brought a pack n play for my 1 year old. There was only a curtain separating the two rooms, so we had to turn our lights off when our kids went to sleep earlier than us, but it was separate enough that we were able to turn them back on after they fell asleep. Continental breakfast was above and beyond the normal airbnb experience and it was quiet and we had privacy even though we stayed in a room in a larger home. Everything was very clean and just as described! There were toys, books, and a playset for the kids. I definitely would stay again."

The home was prestine, very clean and organized. It had everything we needed. Breakfast in the sunroom was so peaceful watching the birds. There was a great variety of choices of things to eat! It was beyond just a continental breakfast in my opinion.
Downtown Elmore was so quaint with many shops and things to see. We got ice cream. Shopped at Mantiques (antique store for men) but us 4 ladies enjoyed going through it, many interesting things from history.
We had a dill pickle pizza at DeStazios, it was so good! So was the Mac n cheese and potato pizza.

Stayed about a week","Here for work, my family visited for a week, and we chose Cyndi and Tim's wonderful home directly on the scenic Portage River. A bird-watcher's paradise, we were entertained daily by the colorful display of robins, cardinals, chickadees and blue-jays attracted to the bird-feeders mounted just outside the wrap-around windows of the sun-room. There we could help ourselves to coffee, Danish and other breakfast treats set out there by Cyndi for her guests.
Our private suite upstairs from the main entrance was easy to access. The grounds were beautiful to wander on a sunny early spring day, and we lingered on the back deck overlooking the river. And our hosts allowed us to prepare a meal in their well-equipped kitchen. By and large, it was a very pleasant, quiet and restful stay and well recommended for weary travelers looking for a cozy, quiet refuge in a stunning setting."

Stayed one night","This was the first trip we had ever made using Airbnbs along the way, so we only realized this was a shared home halfway through the trip. While we were a bit apprehensive at first, in the end the experience was wonderful. We arrived a fair bit later than expected due to traffic in the Chicago area, but Cyndi was still there to greet us and get us situated.
The room was beautifully furnished, the master bed had plenty of pillows, and both rooms had nightstand charging ports for our phones. The two bedrooms are only separated by a curtain, but this didn't pose a huge issue for us since we were only spending a night. There were bottles of water provided as well as a package of Oreos which were greatly appreciated.
The shared bathroom didn't cause any issues either, and was also well stocked with the necessities. Lastly, the sunroom off of the shared living room was amazing. Plenty of breakfast options to get the day started. If you're into our feathered friends, you're in luck as well, bird feeders aplenty.
Thanks again Cyndi, we hope to be back soon!

They were incredibly clear in their communications and notably generous with amenities and food. The suite itself was in impeccable shape--mote than what I'd expected. Most remarkable of all, though, was the unbeatable price. The entire way through, Tim and Cyndi were exceptionally patient, kind, and professional. Thanks again!"

We arrived at midnight after a long hot day at Cedar Point and some rain-delayed travel, and were grateful for the incredibly comfy bed, easy check-in, and abundant bottles of water. Next morning we were off early for more roller coastering, so it was wonderful to be able to grab a few granola bars from the sunroom on our way out. Next time, though, I’d love to sit and savor! Recommended without hesitation."

But, this place was so conveniently located and it worked out great! There is a shared entrance, but the suite is right upstairs with a bathroom just outside the door to the suite. We had total privacy during the stay. The kids absolutely loved the space - perfect set up with 3 beds just their sizes and some toys! We appreciated how convenient it was to the interstate. And we had a great rest there - very comfortable."

We decided to look for an AirB&B for 3 of us, and we were thrilled when we discovered this hospitable B&B. It is super close to the Toll Road, but seems miles away... peaceful and serene. The grounds are lovely, the house is beautiful, the rooms are well appointed and spacious (the one we have stayed in, anyway) and it is just a wonderful place to break our journey. We have stayed there 4, maybe 5 (?) times on our way to and from Michigan, and hope to stay there again in the future. Value for money can't be beat! <3"

Tim and Cyndi have a lovely place and they're very friendly, so made for excellent company/ hosts.

Stayed one night","This is as close to the dream Air bnb you can find. It's close to the highway, but honestly - you drive 10/15 minutes to their house and you'd have no idea you aren't just in the middle of nowhere. They were so kind to us, even though we were hours later than expected. Met us at the door, very genuinely people, very helpful.
The room was beautiful, and had cute chocolate laid out for us, and lots of brochures of what to do in the area. I think I misunderstood the listening - the second ""bedroom"" holds two children's size small beds. Luckily I'm pretty petite and it was perfectly fine for me! It was a little chilly, but that a conversation we had beforehand so it was okay. It was super quiet and peaceful all night.
The breakfast in the morning was a great touch. Fresh pastries, coffee, cereal, orange juice, granola bars, fruit - it felt cozy and warm. We briefly shared the sunroom with another traveling pair and Cyndi made sure to come check on us.
I would absolutely come back here. The atmosphere is great, the house is gorgeous (a little chilly to sit outside, but in a different season I'd live on that deck, phew!), and over all our experience was as close to 5/5 as you can get."

Thoughtful breakfast selections of fresh fruit, eggs, baked goods, various milks, juices, coffees and teas. The breakfast area was nicely decorated, sunny and bright. The bedrooms were roomy, also nicely appointed and very clean. Loved the pillows.
There is a road closure on their street but the detour isn't much of an inconvenience. The small town closest to their home has very limited restaurants and shops so you'll need to travel 20 to 30 minutes to find a variety.

I was there during Biggest Bird week and it was about a 25 minutes from Magee Marsh. The home is absolutely stunning! Blooming trees line the drive and fill the air with beautiful fragrance upon walking up to the door. The common area is to the right as you enter her home and is very large and comfortable, decorated beautifully! Continuing through this a gorgeous sunroom that she has turned into the continental breakfast room . So many choices she offers such as cereals, breads and muffins , hard boiled eggs, bananas, berries and more. There is a little fridge in there with juice, 1/2 and 1/2, almond milk, etc. And, don’t forget the Keurig with many choices of pods and to go cups with lids! WOW! I truly think she should be calling herself a B & B with what she offers! There is a 1/2 bath on that level , and a full bath upstairs where all the rooms are located. The Entire place was spotless and it seems like anything you could possibly need has already been thought of for you!
I really cannot wait to stay again next year !"

Stayed with kids",We did a quick stop on our road trip and Cyndi's place was perfect. We have three young kids and the playset outside and beautiful river front property was perfect for our kids to run around and explore after being in the car all day. And the room was set up perfectly for you family. Thank you!!

Stayed with kids","Cyndi’s home was beautiful, the room and connecting room were more than we expected. I slept so good in the king bed!. We had a local pizza place (Marco’s) that was open til 1030pm deliver to her house. Mozart was their cute and friendly pup. Cyndi also provided some good options in the morning for breakfast. My teenagers and I enjoyed our experience and recommend this Airbnb!! Thank you!"

Stayed one night","Cyndi and Tim’s house is in a beautiful location, off the beaten path but yet close to the interstate. The rooms are clean and well-maintained, the whole space is comfortable and warm. I’m generally not one who likes to stay where I have to share a bathroom, however, I never overlapped with other guests and it was not a problem at all. Can’t recommend it highly enough, I will stay again should I ever be in the area. The carrot bread for breakfast was out of this world!"

Stayed one night","Tim and Cyndi were great hosts and I found the house and bedroom space and amenities to be comparable to a bnb, not airbnb especially since they bumped me up to the suite with a king bed due to being booked. Location wise it was perfect for me midway between Pittsburgh and Chicago (in case you are following that route) and right off I90. Everything was comfortable, clean and very quiet, and there is a veranda and pond for hanging out on a summer night."

Stayed one night",Cyndi’s home is beautiful on the inside and out. We loved the quiet morning in the sun room with the breakfast bar and the keypad for the home and for our private room. Cyndi is pleasant to talk with and had nice little touches for our stay.

I really appreciated the extra special touches, such as excellent toiletries and (most important to me) lots of pillows! The bed was really comfy, and breakfast was very good with excellent coffee. I hope to visit them agIn."

Stayed with kids","We were amazed at how quickly our children warmed up to you and your dog.
This was our first Airbnb, and you definitely both exceeded our expectations and set the bar for our next Airbnb. My family and I cannot thank you enough for your hospitality, quick response, and just general understanding of our noisiness and messiness. We will definitely recommend you to our friends and family."
