Stayed a few nights","This is a wonderful place to stay! Very clean, relaxing, comfy beds, remote, and what you want when you want to get away from it all. We thoroughly enjoyed the stay, and Katherine was wonderful in communicating. We requested some firewood to cook S’more’s and she graciously provided it- unfortunately, it was too hot to use it. Would definitely stay here again!"

Katherine was a very accommodating and responsive host. The treehouse is beautiful (well laid out, well furnished, super clean, beautifully decorated) and the location while remote is what we were looking for. Would love to stay again and highly recommend."

Kat went above and beyond!!!! She left roses, bridal cake coffee, and petit fours on the kitchen table. She even put fake flower petals on the bed. It literally made me cry in excitement to walk into the treehouse. I was able to soak in the tub multiple times with a good book. I sat on the cozy couch looking out to the river and meditated. I cozied up on the bird swing chair and wrote my vows! This place was so magical and the perfect place for solitude! I love a place with no tv. Thanks again for being a part of my special weekend❤️"

Stayed a few nights","We loved Kat’s cabin in Louisiana! While on our honeymoon we wanted to stay someplace special, and the Peace of Soul Cabin definitely fit the bill. The cabin is rustic, but so charming and beautiful. It is within a short drive of nice walkable towns north of New Orleans with great restaurants, grocery stores, and boutique shops. We stayed here after 5 or so days in New Orleans and it was a perfect break from the hustle and bustle. Couldn’t have asked for a better place to relax. Thanks for everything Kat!"

There was an issue with the air condition during my short stay but Katherine IMMEDIATELY came to fix the issue and was so so great with communication. It was of no fault of her own and she did everything in her power to get it up and running! (She replaced & it was cold as could be after that!)
If you’re looking to unplug and unwind— look no further. This is the perfect hidden gym.
Could not recommend Kat or this gorgeous place enough!! Thank you for such an incredible stay."

Stayed a few nights","We recently had the pleasure of staying at the Peace of Soul Treehouse in Bogalusa, Louisiana, and I cannot recommend it enough! From the moment we arrived, we were struck by the beauty and serenity of the surrounding trees and water. The treehouse itself is truly a work of art, with every detail thoughtfully designed and executed. The interior of the treehouse is cozy and comfortable, with all the amenities you could need for a relaxing stay. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and We Loved waking up each morning to the sound of birds singing outside the window. The hosts were wonderful and went above and beyond to ensure that Our stay was enjoyable. They were quick to respond to any questions we had and provided plenty of recommendations for things to do and see in the area. We especially enjoyed exploring the nearby town of Abita Springs and make sure to visit The Abita Farmers Market. if your looking for a unique and unforgettable getaway this is the place to stay!"

I thoroughly enjoyed all the artwork, the fully stocked kitchen, the soaps and toiletries, the games, & the record player. There are plenty of wonderful spots to relax both inside and outside. The only thing I would add is a fan for the bedroom in the main house as that area is significantly warmer than the other bedroom. Apart from that one addition, the Peace of Soul Treehouse was a perfect getaway spot!"

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed our stay! The kitchen was relatively well equipped for cooking, and the record player was a great touch for dancing with the kiddos. We were sad to end up having rainy weather, so were inside more than we’d planned, but there were board games (and we brought some of our own). It was pretty snug for four people, just due to the layout of the house. One of the beds is in the kitchen/common area and one is in a separate, detached bedroom with a shower and sink but no toilet. With the cold weather, it was a little inconvenient to have to walk outside to get to the bathroom for our friends who stayed in the second bedroom. But we all still had a lovely time and there were plenty of blankets and heaters to stay toasty. We had beautiful weather two of our three nights and loved sitting by the fire pit along the river - the views truly are beautiful!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a great time here. Loved looking at the river and sitting by the fire. I really enjoyed the fully stocked kitchen and cooking a meal for us. Exploring the records and games they had was a fun experience as well. We were completely alone, no one was around us/no neighbors, which I liked. Im not sure how it is in the warmer months. It definitely was cold but the space warmers and blankets were enough to keep us comfortable. I’ve been to plenty of Airbnbs, and this is probably one of my favorites. There are some you go to and can tell there is no care put into it. But I definitely felt the quality and care put into this one. I would recommend to anyone. Thank you."

Stayed with kids","Cozy, lovely, and peaceful. A great retreat to stay at home and relax by the river, but a bit of a drive for other activities and restaurants. We originally had plans to visit a pumpkin patch/petting zoo in a nearby town, but once we got to the Peace of Soul Treehouse, the location was so nice that we just decided to stay put for the day instead! We played in the (very cold) river, looked for shells on the beach, caught a fish, read in the hammocks, played corn hole, sat by the fire, ate dinner outside, made s’mores, and laid on a picnic blanket on the beach at night to star gaze. Very clean. Excellent communication from the host. Would stay there again!"

Plenty of seating outside, under the cabin and near by the water/firepit. There are even hammocks in two different spots. Everything is very well thought out for a relaxing stay. Personal touches by the host were greatly appreciated. Don't let the no TV and no wi fi scare you, it's the perfect place to unwind and disconnect. Will be back for another stay."

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful and therapeutic the treehouse is the essence of what the rivers of the West Florida Parishes have to offer. When looking for cabins on the bouge chitta, tchefuncte, tickfaw etc. I didn’t think I would come across a place of this caliber. I highly recommend to my New Orleanians as it makes for an easy getaway cuz it’s an hour from town. Tasteful design, an incredible location on a dogleg of the river, it’s a special place. Even with the river high due to rain while we were there, we still had access to a beach that I was able to launch my pirogue from (yes I am Cajun, we take our pirogues on vacation). We will be back for sure."

I looked at so many treehouse options but when I saw the Peace of Soul Treehouse I feel in love and new it was the one. This place exceeded my expectations in every single possible way. It was an unforgettable experience. We were there for 3 nights and we barely left except to pick up takeout one night. The space is magical with beautiful boho decor and so many little details, records, conversation provoking games, a fire pit, the sound of the river running beside you, a grill, the most amazing claw foot bathtub, hammocks and more! We relaxed, read, connected, meditated, cooked, ate dinner on the river at sunset and most importantly weren’t stuck to our phones and tv. We also spent a night and day in New Orleans before our little escape which was fun. Book this place now and experience the magic!"

Stayed a few nights","So peaceful!
I specifically wanted a place that was quiet, was surrounded by nature and that's exactly what the Peace of Soul offered. My husband and I also wanted to be able to take exciting day trips then retreat to our ""own"" space... mission accomplished! We went to Biloxi for a seafood lunch and a long walk on the beach. Coincidentally, it was Mardi gras weekend, so we ventured to New Orleans. What an experience!! The treehouse seems so far out but it's really just a 15-20 minute drive to sweet Abita and Covington. Kat supplied ample amenities and her special touches throughout the treehouse made our stay a ""home away from home."" The Peace of Soul made our much needed getaway a success!
Thank you Kat and Kevin!"

Stayed about a week","Super sweet host. We loved our one week stay at this peaceful little place! The house is well stocked from the pots, pans, and dishes in the kitchen to the Memory foam mattress in the bedroom. Our host left us plenty of napkins, toilet paper, and trash bags for our stay; shampoo, conditioner, and body wash was also supplied. We brought our own firewood and used the fire pit every evening. The small beach area is a delight, had it been warmer we might have gone for a swim, but it was slightly chilly so we stayed on the beach and enjoyed watching the river. The only thing that could make it better is less road noise, it's pretty close to a well traveled road and you can here the frequent traffic. The house, however, is tucked into the trees so you can not see the road. Overall it was the perfect little get away, and I would recommend this cute place to anyone looking to get out into nature to unplug and relax. "

Stayed with kids","Definitely rural, rustic, private and peaceful. We were a bit surprised with the outdoor shower, there is NO inside shower only a jetted tub in the main bedroom.
Water smelled like sulfur and I believe that’s just Louisiana water. Happy to have a washer and dryer to use (recommend opening the front loaders due to mildew) Master bed is a bit small, we ended up sleeping upstairs with the younger kids and let our teenager have the master. Fire pit, grill and picnic table is accommodating. Kids loved the tire swing.
There are zero towels! (No kitchen, wash clothes or bathroom towels). It works for a nice get away in the country."

He was very helpful when needed. Loved all of the beautiful windows throughout the house which allowed a lot of natural light in. The big front porch was also very nice to sit out on and watch the surroundings. So nice to be away from the rest of the world for awhile. I would most definitely stay here again.

Stayed with a pet","I booked this farmhouse for two weeks for a private working retreat so I could focus, relax, and not be interrupted as I did some development for my company. This farmhouse is a little gem. It'set back on the property so it's very private and quiet, but there are neighbors down the road, so you do not feel too isolated. The farmhouse itself is clean and up-to-date. Yet the decor is cozy and warm, which really helps you feel right at home and relaxed. During my two week stay, not only was there a terrible storm that passed through the entire gulf south, but there was also a hard freeze for a few nights. I really appreciated Terry, the host, messaging to check in while these events occurred. He also responded very promptly to my messages throughout the stay, and I really appreciated that. The kitchen was stocked well with anything you would need to cook. The jacuzzi tub was very relaxing. I loved that Terry welcomed dogs as guests. Definitely will book again!"

Stayed with kids","Wonderful home & host! Joel’s communication was awesome. He responded quickly, was friendly, and was helpful. The home is so cool & has high end touches inside & out. The furnishings and decor were excellent and you can tell a lot of thought went into color scheme, accents, and placement. The place was spotless!
The mattresses were super comfortable & bedding was cozy and so pretty. This is a big one for me with my back. I slept late every morning & woke refreshed
The kitchen had everything we needed & the appliances were very cool. The bathroom had full sized products, a very appreciated touch. The TVs had all the premium streaming services so no worries with logging into our accounts or remembering passwords.
We loved the outdoors. The fire pit and putting green were fun ways to enjoy the outdoors. I loved the big wooden blocks for the fireside and the front porch was my favorite place to enjoy my coffee. The surrounding is all trees & quiet. A peaceful getaway!"

This cabin is it! Had a lovely home cooked meal the 1st night and got to see the sights the second. Honestly it rained both days but the seclusion was worth it all. Great place to get away !

Joel and family were super responsive (less than 3 minute wait time with any message sent) with any questions or concerns and even gave a good list of local restaurants to try out.
The home is in a wooded area so I suggest daytime check in or asking them to leave a light on for you as it can get dark at night.
I can not say enough good things about the property or it’s owners. I highly recommend booking!!!"

It was all so cozy, and exactly what we wanted. Melissa was thorough and responsive, and the amenities were more than we expected."

It is in such a beautiful and peaceful location. Melissa is a fantastic host. From the super quick responsiveness to the assistance and communication of any issues that arose. She gave us a heads up and kept us updated on weather/creek conditions throughout our stay here. She also has this place stocked up with any and everything you may need or forget to bring—which is so very thoughtful and appreciated. We enjoyed the hot tub for most of our stay but are excited to plan another trip during the summer to enjoy the creek more as well. This cabin exceeded our expectations and we can’t wait to visit again!

Stayed with kids","5⭐️ stay! We had the most wonderful getaway weekend @ Creekside 1! Such a cozy, comfy cabin with spacious kitchen, great wifi & smart TVs in both BRs & LR, and light filled with windows everywhere. Above all, the grounds really made the place special. Tall Southern hardwoods and rhododendrons cover the area, with well-marked hiking trails that allow kids to explore for hours. And the river!!! Even though it was shallow, which made kayaking difficult, it was great for kids to wade up and down, play on the sandbar, fish & just sit on the sand & listen to the birds, the wind in the trees and the quiet! Melissa was a very responsive host, answering our inquiries within minutes. Best of all - the property was equipped as a recreational Airbnb should be - all the gear you would need is there: 4(!)kayaks, life jackets, river floats, fishing rods, tackle, and plenty of chairs. Making s’mores & sitting around the fire pit was the best part of the night. Easy access from NOLA means we’ll be back!"

Although we didn't get to spend as much time as we would have liked to enjoying the creek & cabin because we only had 2 days here, this place was very peaceful, inviting and quaint. Melissa did something I've not seen at any other place we stayed, and that was her very thoughtful consideration to children and familes!! We have four kids, and it was nice to see how family-oriented she made this place....little bottles of bubble bath for them, bath toys, s'mores...just very thoughtful, fun things. This place also had WAY more amenities than any place I'd every stayed. We had coffee, condiments, TONS of kitchen supplies, dish soap for more than one washing...just really equipped as if it were someone's house. She thought of everything!! We tried to be respectful to not use much of it, as that isn't really her responsibility to provide all of that, but was sure nice!!! She was extremely responsive to our needs..loved it!"

Stayed with kids","WOW! This cabin retreat is truly a hidden gem, tucked away in the bend of the creek. I spent a long weekend there, just myself and my 7 year old. The cabin itself is roomy and just like home. The beds are extremely comfortable! While we came for the great outdoors, it was nice to have a TV in each room to be able to put on while we were cooking and relaxing. The kitchen is complete with pots and pans and baking sheets, and the fridge/freezer has plenty of room. I was right at home in the cabin.
We spent our days down by the creek, which is easily assessable by a well-worn path and stepping stones. We are able to pull our soccer wagon down to the creek with our chairs, snacks and beach toys. While the creek wasn't quite deep enough on this visit to kayak, we had a blast on the inner tubes, creating our own fast-moving ""lazy river""! Once we tired of that, we tied off to a tree and just floated, gazing at the cloudless sky. The trees surrounding the beach provide the right amount of shade to allow you to spend the entire day out on the water and its sandy shore. We did go for several hikes in the woods, spotting rabbits and squirrels. We saw raccoon footprints by the water, but the elusive creature itself was not spotted. We had fun finding the tracks in the sand and looking them up to see what animal made them.
For our visit, we also had use of the hot tub. That was enjoyable for my son, who had never experienced that! For this old mom, it was a great way to relax in the evening!
I would also be remiss if I did not mention the deck around the cabin. I spent the early mornings, wrapped in a blanket in the hammock, enjoying my coffee and the sounds of the woods waking up around me. So very peaceful.
It is also worth noting that the Wifi in the cabin is very strong. We were able to stay connected, even down by the water. With my job, I needed to be able to access Internet the entire time. I'm happy to say remote work is possible in this cabin and on the beach!
Thank you to Melissa and her family for sharing this space with the AirBnB community."

While it isn't a 5 star resort, we found it to be much better! Accurate to the pictures and description, with even more impressive surroundings. The hosts included everything you could think to need, down to bird seed for the feeder on the deck! Melissa knew we had kids and it seemed she thoughtfully set out kid shampoo, a pack n play, and kids linens, our toddler was very excited about baby shark shampoo!
I echo all the other good reviews and add that the internet service was strong enough for me to have a zoom meeting for work while the TV was running."

The cabin is a wonderful marriage of totally rustic (yes, bugs and such) with lost of creature comfort— soft towels, comfy spreads, multiple TVs, hot tub. It’s not fancy, but darn close. It was perfect for our little family of four. Our boys loved the bunk beds and we spent every day down by the river playing in the beautiful sand. The water could not be more perfect for tots— clear and splashable. We brought some sand toys and had a blast. The owners have thought of lots of great details and are fully accessible if you have questions. We hope to be back! And back and back. My kids are sad to be home already."

We loved being right on the river and spent a lot of quiet time reading and napping on the river hammock. Two minor things to be aware of : the mattresses were really soft and the refrigerator can freeze your food if you are not careful to turn it down. Overall, though, it was wonderful."

Stayed a few nights","We booked Marco’s cabin as a last minute girls trip, & so glad we did. It was just as the pictures & listing described & exactly what we were looking for…quiet, cozy, & secluded, with a beautiful view of the water. During the day we were able to tie our tubes up to the dock so we could hang out on the water & get some sun, & in the evenings we enjoyed the views & sat by the firepit. Marco is an extremely responsive host who truly cares about his guests. The cabin had everything we needed inside & outside. No doubt that we will be returning to stay there again. It’s an adorable little diamond in the rough!"

Stayed a few nights","The location is great. We wanted to go tubing and had several options close by.
State park also only a short drive away. You can reach NOLA in an hour.
Place is VERY quiet. Only neighbour is a larger cabin right next to this one.
Check-in was very easy and exactly as the host had instructed. Joseph was also quick to reply when texted.
The interior is quite rustic - you may love it, or you may not, but it definitely gives you an authentic countryside experience. Plenty of space inside the cabin with two bathrooms, large living room area (could have used a bigger table here) and a fully equipped kitchen.
Plates and pots were somewhat dirty but we managed. Both bathrooms were clean, while sleeping area had its fair amount of dust and spider webs.
So if you are looking for a place off the beaten path, I can recommend going to Bogue Chitto and the cabin in the woods."

Stayed with kids","Wanted to take the kids on a last minute trip just to get away and decided to stay close to our home which is only an hour away, as we both work a lot. So glad we did because we ended up finding this gem. This place is very unique and you can tell whoever built this one and the cottage next door ""The Clampett cabin"" put a lot of love and hard work into it. Had everything we needed and was secluded enough we felt like we were far from home but also close enough to run to the store if we needed something. Its a few minutes from White Sands Beach which is why we chose this spot. After a day there you'll feel like you went on a week long vacation because there's so much to do and it's really a cool place. The host Joseph was quick to respond to anything we needed and made things easy for us to check in,and it ended up costing less than it would cost to be in a hotel room for two nights. Definitely recommend this place. Thank you for having us!"

Close enough for a day trip is The Crosby Arboretum in Picayune which is really cool to visit. But honestly, there's no need to leave the cabin at all if you don't want to.

We got groceries for the week and hardly left the whole week, working during the days and enjoying the porch and massive TV. There’s everything you need for cooking (and ingredients/spices), A/C and fans, super comfy couch, HUGE smart Tv, very comfortable beds, and even an essential oil diffuser. We loved how even little touches were accounted for, and the sri is fast! The dogs from next door came to play and they are super sweet. There’s also complete privacy and nothing around - a whole paddock and forest view to yourself! We would love to come back one day :)"

Stayed a few nights","Cooper’s Cabin exceeded our expectations. We have family in the Mandeville area so it is a perfect place for us to stay. Tina was a great host!
The location is tucked away from other houses offering maximum privacy, peace and quiet. Due to heavy rains and the fact that we had a U-Haul plus a trailer, our host gave us different directions. I followed the wrong sign and missed the cabin the first time around. It was very late and very dark so our host was not immediately available. She did respond and made sure we were settled. The cabin was spotless. The porches were beautiful with peaceful and private views. There were zero safety concerns.
Well appointed kitchen with a large refrigerator, gas stove, microwave and dishwasher, coffee maker, coffee, utensils, etc. Even bottled water which was so appreciated after a long drive and very late arrival.
The two bedrooms were cozy and offered closet space and a chest of drawers. The French doors leading to the porch was a nice touch."

There were also things like canned soup, mac and cheese, coffee, sugar and 1/2 and 1/2. The Wifi was incredibly fast and there was plenty to watch on TV.

Tina keeps the cabin stocked with some food/beverage essentials (coffee, tea) and treats (frozen foods). There are not that many restaurants open late, so having these food items is great! That porch is amazing as well. There are no blinds on the bedroom windows, but that wasn't a big deal for us -- the porch roof provides pretty good morning shade. Their internet is very fast as well. I had no issues with connectivity when I called into a video conference meeting. I would recommend this spot if you are looking for a quiet weekend away."

I had a few questions before our arrival which were answered very quickly.
The cabin is very cutely decorated and has everything I could imagine we would want.
The bed was THE MOST comfortable bed I have slept on in any Airbnb.
Everything was in terrific condition and super clean.
I was a little concerned as I pulled in to the drive and thought that maybe my car may bottom out as it is a very low clearance vehicle, but there was not a problem driving in and out as long as I went slowly.
I would definitely stay again if we are in the area- I would love to sit and relax more on the huge porch."

Stayed a few nights","This accommodation is designed as a guest room. It serves its purpose, good (very high) bed, a TV with Netflix, private parking area behind the house, washer and dryer, a microwave and a small veranda. Sufficient for a short stay. Everything is clean and well maintained. No significant complaints about the accommodation.
The location is just about adequate for sightseeing in and around New Orleans. The drive to New Orleans takes about 75 minutes. This should be noted. That was ok for us as the price was fair.
We didn't like Bogalusa as a place. There was always a feeling of insecurity in some areas, but we felt safe in the accommodation itself.
All in all everything was ok, the distance to New Orleans and the uneasy feeling in Bogalusa are small disadvantages of this accommodation."

The porch is private with rocking chairs, everything is located in the back of the house. Covered parking for your car. There is a washer and dryer to use, which was handy, I had been traveling a couple days when I got there, got to do a load before I left.

Group trip","The cabin was cozy but spacious, we had 10 people and it did not feel crowded. The fire pit was great to hang out by every night, and he even had it running for us the first night we got there! Joseph was quick to respond and was very helpful. Next time we come from MD to visit our family in Louisiana we will definitely book this cabin again!"

The kids were able to explore the woods and make s'mores at the fire pit. Plenty of room for all of the family to stay comfortably. We cant wait to go back, Joe and Renell were beyond hospitable, they were the best hosts ever! We will be back soon to ride in that Apache and '41 Dodge! Thank you... See yall soon!"

Stayed a few nights","Driving down the short dirt road I wasn't sure what to expect, but once I located the camper, it was larger than I had expected, and relatively easy to figure out how to use the water heater, lights, and air conditioning. I never figured out how to use the TV, buteven if I had, I likely wouldn't have used it much, since I needed to finish a book I was reading for work. I was surprised by the nice surroundings and of the nearby river. The place was very quiet. The only drawback, and it is very slight, was the fact that if any food was left on a kitchen counter, ants found it quickly. Otherwise, they didn't bother me while sitting in the recliners, or while sleeping. I'd also suggest replacing the step in front of the door with one that has two or three steps. For me, it was fine, but I suspect others would have a bit of a struggle entering and exiting the trailer."

We loved the linens. My DIL was researching them, on line, to see where could get. I slept very well. We were only there for one night, on road trip from Texas to Florida, so we can’t say we found things to do in the area, except for eating in Covington. Wasn’t too far. Tina even told us some breakfast items were included but we opted for Cafe du Monde. We’d definitely stay again. It was a wonderful stay."

Stayed a few nights","****** THIS PLACE WAS GREAT! ******
My wife and I were needing to disconnect from day to day life for a relaxing weekend. So when we came across Brian's listing we thought it might fit the bill. So I contact Brian prior to reserving the location and asked him a TONS of questions. He was EXTREMELY responsive and quick to answer ALL of my many questions quickly and honestly. Unfortunately due to the rainy weekend we did not take full advantage of all the outdoor amenities this place offered. But, it was exactly what my wife and I needed.
The best thing about our entire experience was Brian. It was a pleasure working with him. We did not need to contact him during our stay except for one time, when I did not know how to turn on the electric fireplace, and he responded with 20 minutes and this was on a Saturday morning. The reason for only needing that one contact was because of how thorough Brian was in preparing his location and his guest (us) for our stay."

They provided extras we weren’t even expecting (like brownies and snacks). The lake and surrounding area is beautiful. We took advantage of kayaks and canoes on site. When we communicated, Brian was responsive. Great place and great hosts!!! Five stars!!!"

Welcome basket was a first for us and we airbnb often. We were in town for a wedding at The Villa, but since we are from the Northshore of New Orleans, we took the short 45 minute drive to see a parade and friends!
In the little downtime we had, we utilized the firepit right outside under those Mississippi stars. We also used the kayaks twice and went around the lake. The yard was sprawling and great for our 2 small pups.
Inside, they even had a dog bed and blanket to cover the couch if the dogs decided to snuggle up there, which they did once.
It is an immaculately clean and beautiful place. Makes me wanna go home and redo so many things in my home! 🤣
Extremely peaceful. Easy to get to. Homey. Perfect stay."

Brian had excellent communication and was prompt with responses and clear directions. We would definitely stay here again the next time we visit the area!"
