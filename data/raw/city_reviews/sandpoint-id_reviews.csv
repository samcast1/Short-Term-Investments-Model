Stayed a few nights","Mike and Emma were excellent hosts. They were quick to communicate and checked in frequently to ensure we had the best stay. They even let us check in early and gave us the option to check out late (we didn’t need to). The home is cozy and the perfect size for two people. If you aren’t as mobile or have a difficult time getting up stairs, you may want to consider a different home. It’s a steep climb up to the bed. We didn’t have any issues, but want others to be aware just in case. The tiny home was perfect for a three night trip to visit some friends in town. We’d gladly stay again! Thanks, Mike & Emma!"

Stayed a few nights","My week-long stay at Mike's Tinyhome in Sandpoint was an absolute delight! Despite its small size, the tiny home offered a cozy and warm atmosphere, even during cooler weather. The shower was nice and spacious, and the well-equipped kitchen made mornings a pleasure. Lounging with coffee and movies was a fantastic way to start the day.
While we didn't get a chance to use the barbecue and bicycles, their accessibility was appreciated. The outdoor lights created a lovely ambiance, and the loft area with its window overlooking the trees and sky was a unique and enjoyable experience.
Mike's guide to nearby activities and restaurants was a valuable resource, and the coffee provided was delicious, introducing us to a great coffee shop. The location of the tiny home was perfect, allowing us to walk around town, explore the beach, and enjoy nearby trails.
In summary, Mike's Tinyhome is a hidden gem in Sandpoint. I highly recommend it for a cozy and convenient stay. Thanks, Mike, for mak"

Stayed with kids",We had the BEST stay in this adorable tiny house! My husband and I stayed there 2 nights with our 3yr-old son and 4yr-old daughter. The kids LOVED the upstairs bedroom loft (1 parent slept with them upstairs and the other on the super comfy futon). The hot water was seemingly endless and the shower pressure was perfect! The place was super clean and easy to find/enter. The dedicated parking spot was well shaded and located right in front of the tiny house (plenty of room for our sprinter van). The location was THE BEST (we walked downtown to restaurants/stores often). The host was very friendly and responsive. I highly recommend staying here- it was an experience our family will never forget (the kids were so bummed we had to leave “their” tiny house). We will definitely stay again the next time we visit Sandpoint!

Mike our host had everything set up and so perfect... he even provided bicycles and locks for our enjoyment that were not part of his listing. The upstairs loft had a great extending window that made it feel like you were sleeping outside under the stars. And he provided a French press and the local Evans Brothers coffee, IMHO the best."

Stayed with kids","This is our 3rd time staying at the Tiny House on 3rd street, it’s become a tradition for our little family. We absolutely love staying here. Everything is so thoughtful from the fully stocked kitchen to the linens and extra blanket and even the bathroom is well stocked. The queen size bed is very comfortable and wonderful to look at the sky through the skylight at night. For a Tiny House I would not expect such details. It truly is steps to downtown area with lots of sweet little restaurants, coffee shops and shopping. Easy walk to the city beach as well. When we travel our goal is to drive as little as possible and this is the perfect place to stay if you want to walk everywhere with ease. We’ll be back again next year!"

And the property itself was a true delight: cozier than even the photos suggest, high quality fixtures throughout, and every little detail thought through to make it feel like home. Highly, highly recommended!"

Stayed with kids","What an excellent place to stay. We are a family of 4, 2 adults and 2 little kids and this worked great for us. The upstairs bed is so very comfortable and spacious. And I’m highly sensitive to sleeping anywhere but my own bed. The weather during our stay was quite cold but we kept warm with just the little space heater provided. The kitchen was very nicely stocked, we didn’t do any cooking but had we wanted to I think it would have been easy. Very close walking distance to anything downtown. Easy parking and we loved that it’s fully gated for our kids. We can’t wait to stay here again in the warmer months to take advantage of the cute deck, fire pit and more of what Sandpoint has to offer! Highly recommend this gem in Sandpoint!"

The tiny house was a fun and unique place to stay, with a bonus private front patio and seating area. It’s very clean and efficient and well organized. We chose to use both the loft bed and the futon bed as two adults used to having a little more space at night and slept well. Mike is a very friendly and accommodating host. He checked in with us regularly and responded quickly to a couple of questions we had. Sandpoint is a destination worth putting in your travel list. The town is charming and walkable and progressive while staying quaint and naturally beautiful. Our friends came for vacation from Florida and purchased a condo to return to immediately upon their return home! Thank you, Mike, for a wonderful stay. I highly recommend this affordable and comfortable and memorable home and experience!"

I arrived on the Amtrak at 2:30AM, but Mike was super helpful with directions and the door access code. The house is cute but very functional with everything you might need. I especially liked the outdoor grilling area and the additional coffee beans with grinder and multiple brewing methods. The loft is cosy, the AC is cold and the WiFi (after a brief tweak from Mike) is fast. The location is great for the wonderful food and drink options in Sandpoint, and only 10 mins walk from the beach- so refreshing to jump in the lake on a warm day.
This is a new property with a couple of small outstanding snag items, but Mike is hugely receptive to getting everything in perfect condition ASAP. I hope that I can come back some day soon."

Stayed with kids","Best Airbnb experience I’ve had to date!👏🏼
Absolutely amazing Tiny home that doesn’t feel Tiny at all, especially with the big yard that includes a fire pit, gas bbq, table, and chairs,and the best part....the hanging night lights on the patio! & That’s just outside!! Inside was even cooler. I took my 6 year old daughter here when I came to visit sandpoint and she absolutely loved it! The loft bed was fun and the sky window above The bed I think may have been my favorite part of the whole home! It opens up and also Has an optional bug screen u can pull down that was perfect for us at night to be able to sleep with the window open! Amazing details in the kitchen- included salt, pepper, spices, coffee, (all organic), & every pot, pan,cast iron skillet, and kitchen item you’d possibly need. And my other favorite part was the built in ceiling speakers that connect to Bluetooth and allowed us to play music whenever we wanted throughout the house! This will be my first choice in sandpoint anytime I return no questions asked!🙏🏻✌🏼👏🏼"

Stayed a few nights","Great place to stay and explore Sandpoint. Nice neighborhood. Mike was very responsive to our requests and had lots of great suggestions. The Tiny House isn’t exactly as described, in our opinion it was even better. We loved sitting by the fire table talking, the deck was great! Inside they have nice dishes and pans and bedding, all much better than I even have at home and actually had to ask where he got some of the kitchen ware it was so nice. The only bad thing I have to say is the weather wasn’t great when we were there, but as far as this place to stay...if you like Tiny Houses, this one is a gem! If you have any mobility issues the stairs to the loft are steep so be aware of that, but they have great hand rails and they aren’t bad. My husband and I are aging so we noticed in a few years we may not be able to climb them. We hope to return and explore more in better weather and when we do we will definitely be staying here if it’s available!!"

The tiny house was adorable and in a really nice location, right downtown and close to restaurants, parks and the beach. We could walk to about 90% of the restaurants we wanted to check out. I was little worried about my suitcase and storage, but there were lots of little spaces to store my toiletries & clothes. The space was so clean and furnished really nicely. It really didn't feel all that small, especially with the nice deck and outdoor space. Another bonus is that while the weather got pretty warm, there was enough shade that we were always comfortable inside. I highly recommend this spot!"

Stayed one night","Wow, what a spectacular view! I decided to spend the night here (versus a chain hotel) before an early morning flight from GEG (Spokane Airport). And I'm so glad I did. As soon as I stepped out of the vehicle, my jaw just dropped. The town and the lake were nestled below us, and it was such an idyllic setting. While I selected the cabin for the view, the interior was equally impressive. The decorations and furnishings all felt like Idaho, and it was evident that the owners wanted to showcase their state and town (e.g., an Idaho license plate and Mickinnick Trailhead sign). It's so wonderful to see the pride of place! The cabin exemplifies the best of Airbnb. A minor side note about Sandpoint is that trains run through the town during all hours. However, this setting in the hills is much better for noise-sensitive individuals than one in the valley. Overall, it was a superb experience and well-run accommodation."

However I am surprised the listing didn’t mention this- and maybe we were just there on an off night- but there is a nearby train that loudly blew its horn nearly every 45 minutes, all night, making it difficult to get any sleep as we were awoken throughout the night. If this wouldn’t bother you this place is a fantastic stay."

Stayed with a pet","Nice clean studio. We only stayed one short night, but it was comfortable. Great views, nice, clean, modern, and private studio, even though the owners are right next door. They had made a nice bonfire by the time we arrived in the evening. Everything was clean, comfortable and in good working order. Apart from the dogs, we had no interaction with the hosts. There seem to be a lot of friendly but big and rumbunctious off-leash dogs around, so if those scare you, make sure to communicate with Erika beforehand (not sure they were all theirs or not)! What we assume to be their dog, a beautiful Irish setter or setter mix, was very very keen to give an enthusiastic welcome. There were train horns that sounded quite loudly from the foot of the hill in the early evening, but I did not hear any between 11 pm and 6 am, when everything was extremely quiet. Lots of deer around!"

The big views and generous windows make this studio feel like more space than you would ever need, yet is smartly compact with modern convivences. Though on the same property as the owner/operator, we felt we had great privacy to enjoy our time on the mountain. The accommodation is well depicted in the description."

Erica and Alex were so helpful. They showed us a short-cut to get to the McKinnick trail which is a must-do. They helped me wash my Stand-up Paddleboard and cleaned the grill for us. The place is not big but has space for everything you bring (we had bikes, SUP, pickleball rackets, cowboy boots, hiking shoes....you name it.). Plenty of space outside to leave your toys. It is very close to town (driving though not walking) and to the lake. Totally comfy and cozy and they make it feel like you are visiting friends. Highly recommend."

Hosts were extremely responsive while providing space and privacy. The trains that others have mentioned were heard, but not an issue for us. We so enjoyed Sandpoint and look forward to another visit soon!"

Stayed with a pet","The house has a great view, super clean and modern and great size. Alex and Erika’s are very nice and friendly. Just being honest though, the only complaint we have (and I’m surprised that other reviews have not mentioned this) is the trains. The expectation of the pictures of the property is it’s quiet and rural since it’s high up on the mountain side. On Friday night the train ran every 45 min and it blows the whistle several times at each crossing. On Saturday night it ran a couple times and no idea what weekdays are like. If you’re a light sleeper this is not the place for you."

The high ceiling, expansive windows, and thoughtful furniture and amenities make it feel large. The concrete floor is a nice touch. The view onto Lake Pend Oreille, Sandpoint, and Ponderay was incredible. I was fortunate to watch the storms roll in from the south on my first night, getting to appreciate lightening. Erich and Erika are excellent hosts. I highly recommend this retreat!"

Stayed with a pet","Absolutely beautiful cabin. Next door to owners home. The front door has windows and no covering, felt like that should have had a covering to help with light in the morning. Beautiful views and thoughtful amenities! Dog friendly but not a lot of room to take the dog potty. We had rain and snowy weather even though it’s April so we did a lot of driving and exploring vs hiking as planned, but still had a great time for our anniversary. Would stay here again if it’s just us and not our kids too."

The real treat was the heated toilet seat in the bathroom. You and Alex truly are 5 star hosts.
Thanks for the memories!

Stayed with a pet","Erika and Alex's place was a top-notch stay! It is exactly how it is pictured in the photos: clean, spacious, stellar views, and all the comforts of home plus a little extra. The place was spotless on our arrival and Alex left us a message when the place was ready for check in. The hosts are very responsive-they live next door and may see them from time to time. We loved staring out the windows at Lake Pend O'Rielle every morning with our coffee that was provided in the home. We truly appreciate dog friendly stays and our hosts were very gracious letting us walk our dog around the property. It is just enough out of town to get that mountain living feel and only a 10-15 minute drive to restaurants and shops. It was about a 25 minute drive to Schweitzer mountain. We would love to stay again and really appreciated having a ""home away from home."" You will not be disappointed in this stay!"

We had car troubles right before we were supposed to head there but Alex was extremely helpful and patient with us as we worked through it. Erika and Alex were so easy to communicate with and a couple times Alex dropped what he was doing to come show us trails or just to make sure everything was going well. He even asked if we needed anything from the grocery store for Thanksgiving because he knew our rental car would be iffy on the ice. The cabin is exactly as advertised and it’s just incredibly beautiful and cozy. This was a 10/10 experience and we hope to be back soon!

Loved the radiant flooring so warm on the feet :) Great view of the lake (we misjudged how close to the water we actually were - thought we could walk to it but it's not that close and is private waterfronts on that side vs some public access across the bridge)

To finish it all off the king bed facing the glass sliding doors looking at the trees and water was just perfect. Such an amazing getaway as both my partner and I enjoyed every second there in peace.

We appreciated the items supplied for the kitchen and laundry, and the AC unit worked great! We really enjoyed sitting on the small deck with a nice view of the pool and lake. We loved using the bikes and kayaks! The bed was very comfortable. The only problem we had was in using the TV. A representative of the hosts and then the host were very responsive in offering suggestions to resolve the Wi-Fi connectivity problem, which was finally done by connecting the TV via Ethernet cable instead of Wi-Fi. However, then the problem was that although it was advertised to have both cable and Netflix, neither were available. Error messages were “TV not part of your Netflix Household,” and “No signal” for TV cable."

Stayed with kids","Great place near the heart of downtown Sandpoint. Being a lower floor unit it was great to have a walkout patio to enjoy the pool area. We were there for the 4th and were able to enjoy the fireworks from the lawn area by the water (at night in the summer wear bug spray for the mosquitoes!). We are a small family of 4, two almost teens and us two adults, and for the summer sleeping was fine. If we all 4 were to be here throughout the day (colder weather) it would be a small space but it worked for us since we were outside most of the day. Thank you for the portable AC unit as it kept the space nice and cool in the triple digits outside. Parking was a plenty even on the holiday weekend. Bedroom bed was quite comfortable. Hideaway was decent. Thank you for the blackout curtains off the patio for the hideaway sleeper use. There were some minor footsteps from neighbors above but not much of an issue. There are docks and a few stairways into the lake but no beach area if that’s what you are after. You can still swim out here at the lake or drop a kayak or floaty. Due to the heat during our stay we didn’t walk to town, we just hopped in the car and parking in town was pretty easy. You could walk but you walk through the back of a gas station and a gap lot to where the sidewalk begins. I’ve been a bit random on this review but just wanted to add info that may be of interest to others. Enjoyed our stay on Pend Oreille!"

Bathroom fully stocked with shampoo, conditioner, soap, towels. Kitchen fully stocked with olive oil, pans, even a blender to make smoothies! The bedroom gets bright, so we recommend bringing an eye patch to sleep in during the summer. Super friendly neighbors, we were fortunate to meet Pat :-)"

Access to the pool, kayaks and bikes were an added treat. and perfect for our first getaway in 2 years. Added bonus was being able to fish on my birthday from the kayaks and from the dock. Communication was superb and we look forward to coming back again next year!"

We loved having the pool be basically right out the back door, and spent a lot of time on the patio in the evenings. Great family friendly condo. We definitely want to come back next year!"

Very clean and well stocked. The washer and dryer were great to have so we could pack light. It's a small space, but that was perfect for our family of three. There is good separation between the living area and the bedroom. The king bed was super comfortable, but bring earplugs and a sleeping mask if you are sensitive. There was a lot of noise from the upstairs units and light through the blinds that made it hard to sleep once the sun came up."

Stayed a few nights","It is a lovely little condo with wonderful Amenities. We did arrive to no heat and tried for a couple hours to warm the condo with a space heater and a couple wall heaters. We only got it up to 55 degrees. But a call to Kara quickly remedied the problem, since something needed to be reset in the heater. I wish we had called sooner because the condo then heated up very nicely. The modern look and extras are what made this condo a lovely place to stay. The pictures don’t quite show how small the place really is. And there are a couple steps in the condo as you first come in. You have to go up those stairs to access the living room and kitchen. The entrance is a bit crowded by the washing machine and dryer which doesn’t give the best first impression. But the bedroom, bath, living room and kitchen are lovely spaces and well decorated. The condo is well stocked and very clean. One surprise though was having to strip our own linens and towels and start a load of wash. Normally this would not phase me, but we paid a hefty cleaning fee and still had to do this."

Stayed with kids","The awesome - This condo is great for a couple. Not so much if you have a baby. So if it was just us I would give 5 stars. Super clean, stocked with all you need and the access to the lake and pool are amazing. Quick responses from penny., the host which was helpful. This place is a great great getaway for the romantic couple. The “okay”, which is why I have it 4 stars....The condo does have stairs in the unit so for a crawling baby - no bueno. If the unit was bigger, a flight of stairs would be no problem, but with little space for crawling and hang out, it makes it tough to block it off. I would suggest this host recommended that the unit isn’t really suited for infants / babies. And the upstairs unit is LOUD. Really really loud. You can hear people walking, flushing toilets and showering.... and conversations. To be expected with an older condo building, I totally get it. So again, if it were just us then we can deal. But for sleeping baby. Eh...... all in all, a great space for us, just not is with baby."

Stayed with kids","This place was lovely! We had such a nice stay! The condo was super clean and well equipped. We are a family of 4 and although it was a little tight in the house- we made it work. We really wanted to be in a lower unit because of the walk out to the grass as we have young kids and it was perfect. It was a lovely space to be in - nice and bright, new renovation, comfortable furniture, great outdoor space and amazing king size bed! We were so comfortable at night! This place is worth the price just for the bed alone! The hosts responded very quickly to any queries and were super accommodating . The washer and dryer worked fabulous! The kitchen was well equipped and such a nice space to be in especially in the morning with the sun! The outdoor deck was amazing- we were out there enjoying it every night for dinner and drinks. The bikes were fabulous! I wish we could of stayed longer. We will definitely miss the convenience of being in that awesome town! Thanks so much for a great stay!"

Kara and Taran created a little Oasis right in downtown Sandpoint, ( just walking distance to shops and restaurants and a leap away from the water.) The decor is filled with a soft and breezy cottage charm mixed with a modern touch. (I was even awed by the linens... so soft and cozy.) The condo is spotless and everything had its place. It was a peaceful place to wake up to with a view of the mountains and just steps away from the water. With a full kitchen and most importantly a Keurig and coffee provided, I had all I needed.

The pool was just off the back deck which made it very easy to go for a quick swim whenever we wanted. We didn't get a chance to use the kayaks or bikes but did enjoy having a tennis court right there. Silverwood Amusement Park/Water Park is only a 30 minute drive. My son and I will definitely stay here again if/when we return to Sandpoint.

Stayed a few nights","Recently remodeled, stylish, and well appointed condominium. Kitchen nice and fully stocked. Nice pool, and complex is on the lake with dock for boats. Kayaks and a bike available from owner. Close to downtown. We really enjoyed our stay. Things to consider: It’s a small single bedroom unit. Not a lot of room to spread out so best for a couple. We had our teen daughter and pullout sleeper sofa worked well but takes up most of living area. Being summer we could expand the living space to lovely deck with dining and seating options overlooking pool and view of lake. If it were winter I’d feel a bit confined. Also no air conditioning and while we loved the heat and sun during our stay, the condo gets quite warm. Ceiling fan in bedroom helped greatly but if you’re used to AC be prepared. Sandpoint is great and this was excellent home base to explore. Go to Evans Brothers Coffee on Church Street for your daily caffeine needs. Five minute bike ride away. I think Sweitzer was about a 30 minute (summer) drive. Silverwood water park about 50 minutes."

Stayed a few nights","A fantastic location! Great space in a quiet condo complex right by the lake. The bikes were awesome and made it super easy to get around town. The place was clean and had everything you could need. It is slightly small, we were four people and this place is better for 2 or 3. The only thing that was missing was some storage space in the living room. We had two people sleeping on the pull out couch and they had nowhere to put their stuff other than the bedroom which is kind of awkward. The patio was great, had lovely dinners out there. We did have a few minor issues (spotty internet and a flat bike tire) but Mike was quick to respond and did what he could to help. I would definitely stay again. The renovations they have done to the place are lovely as well."

Stayed with kids","Everything as described and more! Great location at Condo del Sol but with upgraded features, all new everything! We had a family of 4 stay here easy and the very large TV with netflix and more made winding down for the kids a breeze. Communcation was great and the condo had eveything needed. Pool is right off the comfortable back patio and even lake views. As many of the condo's in the area and as described in the ad there is no A/C in unit, so if you have a summer stay you may want to bring a fan as the main living are is warmed quickly with morning sun! Great stay, will be on the radar for all of our future sandpoint trips."

If you like to run, walk or bike, this place is perfectly located just steps from the lakefront path to the bridge, and a 5 mins walk to the city beach and park. Not only was the condo sparkling clean, it was also modern and functional. We would absolutely stay again and again. 10 stars!"

He was very communicative, provided detailed instructions in advance, and the space was beautifully decorated and welcoming. Parking on the street next to the getaway was easy and felt safe, considering we could see the car from the bedroom window. Unfortunately it was a bit too rainy for us to walk the neighborhood or make use of the hot tub, but we had a lovely time reading next to the fireplace and playing a few of the provided games in the living room. Our stay was comfortable, easy, and quiet - exactly what we needed for a few days away from home."

Stayed a few nights","We LOVED it. Joey's place was the perfect spot for me and my now husband. My parents and family live in Sandpoint, so we rented Joey's place for a few days to visit with family before we headed to Coeur d'Alene for our wedding weekend. It was the perfect apartment for us.
Joey was proactive with communication and extremely responsive. There was a little welcome note and snack basket waiting for us and the home was big enough for us to have my parents and sister over for dinner but also felt cozy and homey for the two of us. I really appreciated the countertop space and bathroom size too. A lot of the homes in Sandpoint are a little older so the bathrooms always have limited countertop space, the showers can be tiny and the bathrooms are just smaller overall. But that wasn't the case with Joey's, it was the perfect amount! We 100% want to stay here again when we come back to visit our family in the future!"

The host provides local coffee beans, along with a grinder, a pour over, and an electric kettle. I’m such a coffee snob that I travel with my own coffee, pour over and kettle, but I didn’t need it here! The coffee was delicious. There are hooks on the wall and what accommodations don’t need more hooks on the wall. Excellent detail!
The place is walking distance to downtown.
Sometimes, AirBnBs have cute pictures and decor but are NOT comfortable. This was both! If you’re coming to Sandpoint, stay here!"

It is the perfect size for two adults as a one bedroom. You are within walking distance of all of Sandpoint attractions, restaurants and shops.
Joey, our host, was friendly, quick to respond and went above and beyond for all of our needs and questions.
We asked if he had a humidifier for the property. We told him it was not a big deal if he did not. He promptly responded that he did and would place it outside of our door within 15 minutes. Joey delivered a brand new, top of the line, personal humidifier at our doorstep.
We parked our car on the street during a snow storm. The plow came by and plowed us in. As we were shoveling our car out, Joey came by, grabbed a shovel and helped us free our car.
This property and Joey are great for visitors to the Sandpoint community. He was our favorite host. We will be back."

Stayed about a week","Joey's apartment is perfect. Neat, clean, thoughtfully designed, little touches of hospitality throughout. My husband and I were visiting Idaho from Virginia to receive medical treatment from a Doctor in CDA, and chose to stay in Sandpoint to be away from the hustle and bustle of the larger city. CDA was an effortless (and pretty) 40 minute commute to our appointments throughout the week and coming back to Joey's apartment each day was a retreat. The apartment is located on a very quiet street, yet walking distance to everything downtown Sandpoint has to offer - especially two grocery stores! The very private hot tub was such a relaxing treat; what better way to start the cool mornings relaxing in the hot tub with a cup of Evans Bros. Coffee Joey so graciously provides? Perfection! The balcony off the bedroom was wonderful for an afternoon cocktail or two. Everything about the apartment was so comfortable and welcoming! For those mornings we didn't feel like making breakfast, we loved Connie's Cafe - every meal delicious! We would not hesitate to stay at Joey's Garage Apartment again - highly recommended! Thank you, Joey; job well done. 👏"

& modern decor that was comfortable with nice touches. Clean and surprisingly spacious for a 1 bedroom. The little extras that included snacks, local coffee beans and a welcome note were lovely. We didn't get to try out the hot tub but it was nice knowing it was available.
Communication was great and our week overall a great experience."

Everything was clean and the hot tub was very relaxing! This is a great location and an excellent host!

Stayed a few nights","So many others have said it, this is THE BEST Airbnb we've ever stayed at. Comfortable beds, super clean home, well stocked with goodies and coffee, immaculate set up, and very thoughtfully designed. As a person who doesn't love super strong fake fragrances I also appreciated the scent free laundry detergent and the fact that there is not an overwhelming aroma to the place- you know how some Airbnb's try and be so 'fresh and clean' smelling and it's just fake fragrances- not Joey's! His place smells clean because it is SO clean. Very walkable to everything downtown, the bike path is close by, and the lake shore is just short walk from the spot. Super private and quiet as well. We loved Sandpoint!"

Stayed a few nights","Thanks so much, Joey! Your place was awesome!
Our only complaint was someone going in and out of the garage most of the afternoon on Saturday, clanging around, and extra noise. We didn't use the hottub as we didn't realize you had to go out and around through the front along the street. So, maybe if that's better disclosed? We only had brought boots and didn't have shoes to wear or a swim coverup. So, rather disappointed.
But, everything else was great!"

Stayed a few nights","This was our favorite AirBnB ever; and we stay at quite a few AirBnBs! The location was very convenient to grocery stores, downtown, hiking, skiing, etc. The bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, and living/dining area were very spacious. The furnishings were all high end, and the artwork was very tasteful. I love to cook, and found that the kitchen had everything I needed. The knives were sharp, and the refrigerator was clean and free from leftover food from other renters. (I hate dull knives and other people's food.) I appreciated that the door-entry code was customized for our stay, so we knew nobody else would have access. Joey responded immediately to the few questions I had before our stay. He provided coffee beans, tea bags, seltzer, and welcome snacks, which was a nice ""extra."" And the hot tub was perfect for after skiing! We sill definitely plan to stay here whenever we visit Sandpoint."

It’s such a beautiful newly renovated apartment over the garage, 2 blocks from downtown Sandpoint and across the street from a grocery store. Joey has made a beautiful space with every amenity you could ever need. He went above and beyond to give us local recommendations for a wonderful thanksgiving dinner and his favorite local spots to eat. The jacuzzi was so nice to have as an added amenity and the kitchen was fully stocked with anything you might need to cook. He thought of everything from extra pillows to coffee to laundry to extra blankets, to games and activities to do around town. His space is super cozy, beautifully decorated and made us feel like we were right at home. The little details make the value absolutely worth it and his communication and directions for our stay were timely and clear! We will be back!! I cannot give enough praise to this little slice of heaven in Sandpoint, ID."

The bedding and furniture were all clean and comfortable, there was a great variety of cooking essentials if desired and a wonderful “coffee bar” with locally roasted beans. We did not do any cooking since everything is within easy walking distance. If I ever travel through the area again I will definitely check if the apartment is available.

Stayed a few nights",The pictures don’t reflect how special this setting is. You are right on the lake with eagles soaring above and a cool breeze to help you sleep like a baby. Jon and Becky shared their swim dock and kayaks so we could get out in the lake. The property is gorgeous. Becky provided fresh cherries from their tree along with lots of other personal touches. A truly magical place.

It was clean and lovely and had everything (& more) that we needed. We loved being right on the lake and being close to Sandpoint- got to canoe, swim, hike, explore, rest & relax. Would love to stay here again soon and highly recommend it!"

The view of the lake was incredible and so relaxing. The bed was extremely comfortable and waking up to those views was breathtaking. Having access to a dock with kayaks was a lot of fun and there was also a basketball/pickle ball court to play on. The hosts left homemade goodies in the treehouse like honey, jam, lemon tart, bread and more. This was a wonderful touch and everything was delicious! Thank you for an incredible stay and for being such wonderful hosts!"

One word of warning, while surprising your wife/partner with a trip to the treehouse is a great idea, you might want to monitor their suitcase choice... A huge suitcase and the treehouse stairs/ladder can be a… let’s call it a comedic event!

Stayed a few nights","The treehouse was exquisite and like a dream. The attention to detail, cleanliness, and location were awesome. I'd recommend a sleep mask as the treehouse has a ton of windows to see out of many angles but no curtains. This was no issue to me because I'd figured as much and brought some. There is also a train that goes by, not a big deal but good to know if you're a light sleeper. Lastly I would recommend that you take the stairs inside the treehouse without shoes or socks, my husband actually fell down the inside stairs as they are very smooth and slippery. All in all we had a lovely time and a fantastic and unique experience with a great host. I look forward to returning some day."

It is now one of the most favorite places my wife and I have stayed. The pictures actually don't do the treehouse justice. It looks nice in them, and it's even better in person. The location is AMAZING. You wake up to tons of natural light and a resort-like view out on to the lake. All of that and a cup of coffee are an amazing way to start the day. Jon and Becky are exceptional hosts and go out of there way to add lots of little touches to make your stay even better. They are just great people too - which is a huge plus. Again, if you are thinking ""maybe"", the answer is ""yes!"" Just do it - you'll be glad you did..."

We happened to be here on the night of a thunderstorm. Being in a treehouse during a thunderstorm is loud. I would recommend bringing earplugs.
Because of the weather, we didn't have the opportunity to use all of the outside amenities. Even still both my husband and I would happily recommend the treehouse to others."

Stayed a few nights","Becky and Jon are the best hosts that I have ever encountered. I'm convinced that they do it for fun. Becky left fresh flowers and very nice shampoos and soaps. She is also an organic chef so she leaves delicious treats once in awhile. I can't even make this stuff up. If I were to ever be a host, I would try to be like them. The treehouse was amazing. I felt like we had the best of both worlds. We were very close to all things we needed but I also felt like we were a world away up there. The eagles in the tree were amazing. The train that periodically came by reminded me of my childhood home. We had a storm come in the first night. The treehouse was pretty noisy during that. It didn't bother me at all. I thought it was pretty cool. My husband ended up needing some earplugs to sleep well so maybe pack some of those. You won't regret coming here."

Stayed a few nights","This treehouse is the truest example of “even better in-person.” While the photos and description of Jon and Becky’s place look incredible, I assure you that the real thing is even better.
From the moment we set foot on the beautifully maintained premise, Jon and Becky approached with an aura of joy and positivity that stayed with us throughout the remainder of our stay. They had wonderful local suggestions and truly provided an exceptional experience for us.
The treehouse comes exactly as it is described- small but quaint and grants every “escape” one could ask for when looking to take some time away from the hustle and bustle of any city.
If you are lucky enough to find an opening in the reservation schedule, jump on it and do what you need to free up whatever else is on your schedule- it’s worth it.
As with many before us who wrote about their experiences in the guest book, we look forward to our return trip in the (hopeful) near future. Thank you again for providing us with such an memorable getaway, Jon and Becky!"

The history of it all captivating and you catch yourself reflecting on it. Kayaking the lake in the morning when the water is like a sheet of glass is a must. Your head will never be so clear. Deer eat and play in the yard. And I woke up my last day to a Moose and baby in the yard, just feet away from the treehouse. A MOOSE! The horseback riding in the mountains was fabulous. The local food and fare superb. Farmers Market had the best goodies. Thank you both for sharing God's beautiful gift with me!"

Stayed a few nights","This amazing treehouse, right on the bank of Lake Pend Oreille, is the best airbnb I've experienced in my 10 years of traveling. Becky gave me a tour when I arrived. I was in incredulous delight because there were so many artsy, unique, and thoughtful touches. The photos are great, but experiencing the space as a whole was an entirely different level of charm and whimsy. The decorating and restoration of antique furnishings and appliances is brilliant . I especially loved the bronze -fronted fridge (which held organic o.j., homemade raspberry jam, cheese, eggs, and English muffins. I slept like a baby in the cozy, comfy loft bed. There are lots of high quality toiletries, guest bathrobes, and great reading material such as a book of treehouses of the world. There are binoculars to focus on the bald eagles and osprey near the lake. I ended up spending most of my time in the living room or on the porch of the treehouse, just soaking in the panoramic view. I didn't want to leave to go visit anywhere else. And I didn't want to leave when my check-out time rolled around. I'll be back, but next time for a longer stay!"

Stayed a few nights","The pictures do not do this place justice.
The location has a quaint, rustic, and wonderfully cozy feel. The views of the lake are breathtaking and awe-inspiring, and it's such a wonderful and welcoming place. We mainly interacted with Becky, who was the picture perfect hostess, even going so far as to give us banana bread as a parting gift! We even stayed an extra day, and Jon was super chill and helpful when it came to pushing our stay forward.
The main thing this place has going for it is its uniqeness. Nobody you ever known has ever stayed in a place quite like this, and I even took a video on my phone to show folks back home. ""Wow"" and ""where is that??"" were the universal reactions to the video. The kitchen is fully stocked, down to even a blender, and fresh greens, orange juice, and local coffee beans, in the fridge, and more besides. It's hard to put into words how lovely our stay was there, and we'd undoubtedly do it again.
The one thing I would say is that the location was not quite as private as we were expecting. It is located on the family's property, and they often have children and grandchildren visiting, so even though the main house is a good 75 yards from the treehouse, the dock is right in front of the treehouse, so if you're there on a romantic weekend, don't plan on just strutting around naked like you own the place, as there are many large windows and absolutely no curtains. This isn't a knock against the place, though - merely something we didn't quite get from the listing. I'd still recommend it in a heartbeat. We're extremely pleased. :)"

Stayed a few nights","Expect to be thrilled!! It is a beautiful treehouse right on the lake. Well maintained landscaping. Be prepared to walk aways through wet grass from your car to the treehouse. As you probably have read, the stairs are part spiral and part straight-up both outside and in. I got the hang of it pretty quickly, but don't bring a ton of luggage or bags (especially if you are solo) or it will be a struggle. They have everything you need kitchen-wise--no toaster oven or regular oven, but there is a stovetop and a microwave. The bed and a closet are all that is on the second floor (wonderful bed!) so, if you get up often in the night you will have to carefully go down the steep stairs to the very cool galley bathroom! There is a floor above the bedroom as well, where you can look out through the trees at all the beauty, or it makes a great meditation area--very steep ladder to get up there.
All in all, I had a wonderful solo trip--it isn't far from town at all for dining out and shopping in Sandpoint--I love their food coop right on the edge of town, there is a spa on the way to town (Highland) if you would like a massage or facial, etc., and so much more!
I would love to go back to the treehouse next year--it is so unique!"

The treehouse itself is just amazing. So many little touches and so functional for such a unique space. We loved the top lookout floor for reading with the breeze coming in through the windows. The bed was very comfy. The lake is right at your feet and we loved the use of the private dock with kayaks and paddle boards each day. There are also natural stone stairs leading into the lake if you don't want to jump off the dock for a swim. This place is so peaceful and private. The hosts were great and on our second night during a wind and thunderstorm Hailey even texted us offering to have us hang out with them at their place if we felt unsafe, which was very thoughtful. We chose to stay in the treehouse during the storm which was a pretty cool experience in itself! We stayed for three nights and were so sad to leave. Every minute we spent here was relaxing and joyous, such a wonderful place!"

Stayed a few nights",We loved being right on the lake in this unique space. It was great having use of a canoe and kayaks to explore the lake. The treehouse itself is so fun and artsy. Hailey provided some nice extras. We enjoyed just hanging out in the cozy space enjoying all the thoughtful touches.

Stayed a few nights","My boyfriend and I stayed two nights in the treehouse for his birthday and it was absolutely amazing. The location, cleanliness and general atmosphere of the place is all unbeatable. Truly a magical experience, even bald eagles flying around the treehouse most of the day! There was even fresh eggs and homemade apple butter in the fridge for us! Both of us so were beyond sad to leave, and we will definitely be back as we’ve completely fallen in love with the treehouse! Best Airbnb experience yet. Book more than two nights. You'll be glad you did."

Stayed a few nights","The 2 night reservation in the treehouse was a gift from my husband for my 64th birthday. It will go down as one of the most memorable. Hailey greeted us upon arrival to guide us to the treehouse Hailey is so welcoming and very laid back..her personal touch (fresh fruit bowl & fresh flowers) add a special welcome as you walk thru the door. The beautiful stained glass door (glass compliments of Ireland) immediately tells you..this is a treehouse like no other! For me, it was jaw dropping beautiful..hand carved wooden couch with overstuffed pillows and windows that offer a panoramic view of the beauty that surrounds you. Seated right on the lake you can sit on the porch to enjoy sunrise/sunset; or, walk down to your own private beach and dock.
California king bed guarantees a good night's sleep..you don't need to bring your own pillow from home, the ones provided are perfect. Inside and out the treehouse is a once in a lifetime adventure."

The treehouse is unique and the views are amazing. Jon and Becky are thoughtful hosts and their property is a small slice of paradise. We would definitely return and we highly recommend Jon’s place if you’re seeking a unique and beautiful lodging on the lake, with full use of your own dock, kayaks and paddle boards, very handy access to both paved and mountain bike trails, and in close proximity to Dover and Sandpoint. So relaxing. Thank you, Jon & Becky!"

Stayed a few nights","We knew as soon as we saw the listing this place would be special, and we were not disappointed. We were looking for a quiet getaway from our busy lives and the treehouse provided just that. The view couldn't be beat and with a couple eagles that liked to occupy one of the trees above us, we were treated to wonderful sounds each morning. This treehouse is a gem from the perfect decor down to the small design details. Absolutely beautifully made.
Jon and Becky were gracious hosts, meeting with us to give us a little history of the peppery (also beautiful) and making sure we felt at home.
If our travels ever bring us back to this area, we will return to this peaceful getaway."

First off the treehouse is full of character - the detail and design from the unique design features to the furniture gives it such a homey feel, and the views are spectacular - not to mention being among the trees. Being right on the lake was perfect for a relaxing weekend - you can enjoy a cup of coffee and watch the sunrise from the porch or living room, sit on the dock, or kayak on the lake. Jon gave an informational tour when I arrived of the history of the treehouse and a run down of some things to do in the area - he was a gracious host and helpful as I began to plan out my weekend. I would highly recommend staying at the treehouse - it is a once in a lifetime opportunity and Jon and Becky couldn't have been more kind and welcoming!"

Stayed a few nights","This cabin was so perfect. It’s set a bit farther back behind a house, which I loved for the privacy. There’s TONS of natural night and the main window is right in front of some pretty hedges which makes the view feel secluded but also nature-y. The natural wood throughout felt like I was in the middle of no where enjoying a cabin vacation. I really enjoyed the no TV aspect. It forced us to just enjoy time napping, exploring, and doing a puzzle! It was a great weekend in plugging.
The cabin is just a 5 minute walk to a natural grocery store, so many restaurants and shops, and the YUMMIEST coffees we’ve had, at Evans Brothers roasters.
Lisa was a great host with super fast communication and willing to help out in any way she can!
This cabin is seriously perfect and I recommend it 💛"

The only exception is that it does not have a television. However, it does have Wifi, so if you really want to watch something, you could use your laptop/smartphone. The owner, Lisa, responded to questions quickly via Airbnb messaging. It's location in South Sandpoint is perfect--within walking distance (or short drive) to restaurants and shops. Took only 25 minutes to drive to, park at top of Schweitzer Mountain. We would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","Great location, great place. BUT the bathroom was disgusting, there were no cleaning supplies and the owner living on site wasn't available during my entire 4 night stay. I had to buy my own cleaning supplies.
There is no curtain over the sink in the kitchen making it able for you to look in the owners bathroom....
But they can also look right back at you and if you're (semi) undressed walking around they will see you. The lack of privacy made me very uncomfortable.
Hot water heater is too small, I was warned upon check-in but that doesn't make it better. Install a normal water heater for heavens sake. The shower head puts out a huge amount of water and if you shower on full blast you will not last with that water heater. A water saving shower head would be a better match with this tiny water heater."

Highly recommend!"

There is no counter in the bathroom which makes it spacious and there are small shelves to use. There were bikes to use and pets are allowed. My Subaru Forester was a snug fit to park the garage but it all was great. We would definitely stay again."

Stayed a few nights","As good as advertised! Fantastic location that’s easy to walk to all the cool stuff. The inside was minimalist, but very clean and perfect for a solo person or a couple.
Brad was responsive, accommodating, and a great communicator. I ended up losing a key and he took care of it right away.
The entrance is a bit goofy because it’s through the alley and it gets pretty muddy, but no big deal. The trick with the rain shower is to not have it on full blast as you will run out of hot water quickly.
Overall, one of the best values in town and highly recommend!"

Stayed with a pet","Bret’s place was a great getaway for a long weekend of skiing, and we were also able to bring our dog! The location was perfect — a short jaunt into town for restaurants, groceries, and cute shops.
Finding the stay was straightforward enough, and check-in was a breeze. Having the garage for our car and ski stuff was a huge plus as well. We had no problem parking an SUV in there.
The place itself was simple and had everything we needed to be comfortable including shampoo/conditioner/soap, kitchen essentials for eating, and extra towels and linens. It was super clean upon our arrival, and the shower was a wonderful treat after a long ski day, although the hot water tank is on the smaller side. The bed was comfortable, temperature control was easy, and the TV was a nice way to decompress.
Bret’s communication leading up to the trip and during our stay was fantastic. He was easily reachable, and his replies were always timely and informative.
Overall, I’d definitely recommend it!"

Stayed with a pet","Bret's place was very conveniently located for my visit to Sandpoint, within walking distance to the Panida Theater, where one of the shows that brought me to town happened. The room was well-furnished and cozy warm, the fridge had its own freezer and the microwave did its job well. Bret's instructions were very helpful, as the popular Maps app starting with G was confused by the fact that the airbnb is behind the main house on the street. I kept thinking of questions for Bret, but always seemed to find the answers before I could ask. I'd happily stay there again."

There is a single car garage to park in if you have a small car or SUV, definitely couldn’t park my truck in it, but that was no issue because there was ample street parking.
The 2 bikes that were supplied were in good condition, they were a really awesome touch & made getting around & enjoying a few days in Sandpoint super fun!
I definitely recommend staying at Bret’s place, if you are a solo, or a couple!! Plus the bed was SUPER comfy!"

Stayed a few nights","I was looking for a place to stop for a couple of days between Mt Rainer and and Glacier National Park to relax and maybe listen to some live music and enjoy some good food. Bret’s place is a 12 min walk to the Festival at Sandpoint. The parking is limited at the venue and Brett‘s place is nice short walk through some beautiful homes. Having all of a gear in our car it was nice to have the garage. Our Subaru Outback with a rooftop tent had no problem fitting in there nicely.
It’s a cute cozy one room studio over a garage with one of the best showers on the planet."

Stayed with a pet",The best thing about this Airbnb was its location. Breweries like Matchwood and Utara were within walking distance. The shower was spacious and the bed was comfortable. I’m glad there was a garage but my Toyota RAV4 barely fit. Just be aware that if you have a car larger than a compact SUV you’ll have to park it on the street (there was plenty of parking). Oh and bring an eyeshade for when you sleep if you plan on sleeping past sunrise. The church style windows are cute but let in lots of morning light. Overall this was a solid place to stay and I’d recommend it if you’re looking to explore Sandpoint.

I did cook a few meals in the unit, despite the limited cooking amenities (microwave and small fridge). There are many restaurant and a natural market close by. All in all, a nice spot."

Stayed a few nights","Chapel by the Pier is located in a very convenient and quiet location near to downtown Sandpoint. It is easy to find and it is also near to the water, both the lake and the river. This is a modern rental with beautiful glass church glass windows. It's private and has all the modern conveniences one would need. It is adequately separate from the host's residence. The bed was very comfortable, the shower was lovely. We were advised to be judicious using the hot water. We had no problem having enough hot water for two showers a day in 5 days of staying there. The lighting was great in the rental. The sliding glass door gave us some fresh air. Bret responded to any needs we had and he communicated very well checking to see if we had all that we needed. We liked the place so much that we're going back in June!"
