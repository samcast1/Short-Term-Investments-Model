Stayed with kids","Amazing modern farmhouse. We rented the airbnb for a wedding and felt right at home. It was a beautiful home and at the end of the trip, our five year old was convinced he wanted to move there. Our daughter was in a wheelchair and it was accessible."

It was definitely Central California country - beautiful green flat yard with a great view of the Sierras from the living room and kitchen windows. Additionally it was in great location for us. Will definitely rent again the next time we are in the area."

Group trip",The house was perfect for our larger group. It was centrally located but felt country. It had an easy flow with comfortable furniture and beds. The kitchen was awesome and pretty well stocked with gear. The neighbor was friendly with lots of animals. Roosters were up right on schedule each morning. We loved watching sunsets and sunrise each day out the big back window. And seeing the gorgeous Sutter Buttes are an extra bonus! We highly recommend.

Stayed one night","HOSTS:
The hosts were great, very responsive, and friendly. Easy check-in with electric combo lock.
HOUSE:
This is a very beautiful house, very modern, new design and freshly built. However, not very furnished. Felt very cold and had lots of empty spaces. Almost an echo chamber. I would suggest adding more artwork or area rugs to tone down the echoes.
AMENITIES:
House had all the basics, however, they're not listed in the ad. We were unsure if it was a fully stocked kitchen or not. We were looking for the BBQ that was in the photo however, luckily I asked before I got there and said there is not a BBQ. We went to use the dishware and some of it was still dirty. The cleaners need to do a better job and looking at these before putting them away. We had to clean them before we used them. The cabinets were dirty and didn't close.
LOCATION:
This is in a rural area, however, don't expect the neighborhood to look exactly like this house, because they're not.
I have more but Im out of wor"

Stayed with a pet","Christina and Steven’s place was perfect for my family’s holiday trip. We were able to cook a meal in their spacious, well-equipped kitchen, watch an important (to me, anyway) football game on their huge TV, and there was plenty of space to set up a jigsaw puzzle. The house was super clean and tidy, and the beds were all comfortable. Plenty of bathrooms for the five of us, and a huge yard that we would have made better use of if we’d been there at a warmer time of year, I’m sure. I’d happily stay here again if I’m ever back in this area. Thanks for having us!"

Barnyard animals next door were kind of a treat. Loved the butlers pantry! Well stocked kitchen. 2nd dishwasher was out of order, but that was not an issue for us. Cooked dinner for 6, nice appliances, easy to use and very clean. Adjustable and massage bed in the master suite was phenomenal! Really enjoyed! We will definitely recommend this home and be back!"

Stayed over a week","The house was lovely and the surrounding area was nice also. We came to the USA from UK to visit family and stayed for 11 days so it was like going from home to home.
The facilities within the property were in good condition and it was very clean inside. Christina and Steven answered our questions and were accomodating with our requirements.
The garden was nice to spend in first thing in the morning before it got too in the afternoon. We all had decent sleep. If you're in the master bedroom the farm animals are a bit of a wake up call early in the morning but our kids loved seeing them in the morning. Overall good hosts, lovely house and a wonderful time spent. Thank you."

The Master bedroom can get really bright in the morning but if you’re a deep sleeper, you should be fine. It was nice waking up in the morning and watching the neighbors farm animals and enjoying the sunrise. I was not ready to leave. I definitely recommend this place. Thanks again Christina for having us!"

The house was very spacious, clean and full of light
It would have been nice to have hotel style luggage racks on which to set our bags in each room and firewood for the fire pit.
The dogs and various farm animals next door can be noisy at times, so if that’s something ud find bothersome this may not be the place for u
Host was efficient in her communications and the California strawberries we got from a local vendor were delicious!"

The house had lots of amenities like a Keurig, iron and ironing board, towels, and shampoo and conditioner in the bathrooms. The kids room was really cool as it had a bunch of books which I read to my son. There were TVs in each of the four room as well as a really big one in the living room. There was lots of glasses and dishes as well as good cutting knives. Christina was very helpful and responsive as unfortunately we forgot a few things at the house. She helped in getting those returned. If you want a clean house out away from the city this is perfect."

Stayed with a pet","Christina's place is true to photos - large, bright, airy, and modern. The kitchen is well stocked, the beds are comfortable, the bathrooms are cozy. Lots of useful modern tech, including Keurig, smart TVs, great Internet, Nest. There is a wonderful kids' room with lots of books and toys. The backyard and front yard are large and green. Lots of parking on the side of the house. The house is on the outskirts of town, about 10 minutes drive from good coffee (Bridge Coffee Co.), bakery (Stephen's Farmhouse), organic grocery (New Earth), Target, etc. Christina was very easy to communicate with, prompt and friendly. When some issues came up, she responded fairly quickly and attentively. One note - the neighbors have horses, chickens, roosters, goats, and dogs. It's fun for kiddos to see but they can be a tad noisy at night so if you're a sensitive sleeper, ear plugs or sound machine is helpful. If we're in the area again, we'll be sure to stay here!"

Check in was a breeze. House is set back from the street, so that is nice. Quiet neighborhood. Hosts were communicative and responsive to my questions and needs. Love the bidet toilet & electric fireplace under the TV in living room. (Two totally opposite things!) Nice to see cast iron in the kitchen. Awesome pillows and bedding. Great sunrises and sunsets from the plentiful windows. Plenty of room for the parents (94 year olds) with walkers to move around. Nice to have a couple bed choices for them as well since lower beds are what they can get into. All in all a great choice and stay for us."

And I just have to say ALL of the beds are incredibly comfortable. Haven’t slept that good in years and my 6 month old even slept through the whole night in the master bed. It was a miracle. LOL you and your family must stay here, it is cozy and comfortable in every way. Thank you again Christina and Steven!!"

Nicely designed house with great flow and plenty of room for all of us. My chef son was impressed with the kitchen and the Kamado grill. The kitchen island was a great place to hang out and the back yard is so peaceful. We loved watching and listening to the animals next door from a respectable distance. Loved that the kids room had toys and books available. If we had more time I would love to read some of the books available in the spare room.
Definitely hope to return for future

The place was immaculately clean and fully equipped. We all had plenty of space to spread apart or cozy up. It was conveniently located as well. Our host was very responsive and patiently answered my many questions and went out of her way to make us feel comfortable, even dropping an air mattress by so our two young granddaughters could spend the night. Thank you for such a positive experience. We had a great trip, would definitely stay again and highly recommend this place!"

The bidet, shower and bed are wonderful little hidden gems this place has to offer. The mood lighting and kitchen amenities are also fantastic add ons! Jonathan is a wonderful SUPER-host; very responsive and respectful. He showed me that he really cares about his guests’ experience and is willing to effectively ensure things go as smoothly as possible!
I had an issue with initially getting into the unit, but Jonathan assisted me immediately and unlocked the door remotely then resolved the unlocking issue right away, so that I could move on with my trip and not worry about getting back in later on in the night.
All things considered, this is a great place to stay topped with a gracious host and I definitely recommend anyone to enjoy this experience! I would gladly stay here again myself! Thank you Jonathan! It was great!"

Glass all in the doorway of the bathroom I notified Jonathan he came immediately and cleaned it all up. He even offered a different location since that one had a minor issue. We did decline the offer. However that was very thoughtful! The property was very clean otherwise and safe. I will be staying here again if it’s available next time I’m in the area!

Stayed a few nights","This place had the best bed we have slept on in any Airbnb. We slept so soundly in that bed! The neighborhood was nice and quiet. The location was great. The only reason we didn't give a five star rating was because we encountered a fly problem in the apartment. When we arrived there were a couple of flies in the apartment. We quickly killed them but then a couple of other flies appeared. In the three days that we were there, my husband killed at least ten flies. I also did not care for the toilet seat/ bidet combination. I like to go to the bathroom in private but the toilet seat/ bidet would make a beeping sound that can be heard in whatever room you are in, in the small apartment the minute someone sits on it. Maybe there is a way to shut that off but there were no instructions for the bidet seat. It was still a pleasant stay. Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","The place was much better than I expected. The pictures do show you everything you need to see, but don't quite capture the spaciousness of the unit - primarily in the bedroom. The Cali King bed seems small in comparison to the rest of the room.
Kitchen is stocked with everything you need, including pots and pans, cutlery, silverware, and dishes. It shares the main space with the dining area, which is against the opposite wall of the bedroom door.
Bathroom has a very simple, but nice layout. You must go through here or the side gate from the outside in order to get to the backyard.
There is only one thing I wasn't too comfortable with, and that is the random locked door in the bedroom with a built in window and blinds (which are only accessible on your side), which you are unable to get into. Seemed to lead to a storage room between the unit and the main residence, perhaps where the cleaning supplies are kept.
Aside from that, no complaints"

Sharalee is a super host! She is was easy to reach and responsive even when we realized on our first night there that the house didn’t have the right sized coffee filters we’d need in the morning. She made it happen so we all had hot coffee in the morning! Really enjoyed our stay. Oh and

Stayed a few nights","Sharalee was very responsive and helpful when I reached out to her. Our dates and number of people changed and it was very easy to make the adjustment. The house is
spacious and comfortable. It had a ping pong table and foosball. Plus outside there were play equipment for kids to play with. Beds were spacious, comfortable and each room had a ceiling fan and television. It is a great place for a family to visit and have lots of entertainment. The location of the house was close to downtown and very easy access to locations we needed to go. We would stay at her place again."

The beds super comfortable and it was a nice quiet neighborhood. My wife and my two kids ages 11 and 13 all loved staying here. It’s such a better deal than getting a couple hotel rooms. The house had a very homey feeling. Sharalee was able to give us a late check out, so we made sure we left the house clean as possible. Would recommend this place to-anybody staying in Yuba City or Marysville… you won’t be disappointed."

I docked a star for a couple reasons: 1) AC was horribly loud so I had to turn off the AC at night to be able to sleep 2) not a fan of being required to strip the sheets. Dishes are understandable but we are paying a cleaning fee so leaving the premises in the condition it was in when we arrived makes it seem like we need to clean the place."

Very well clean and organized. Very spacious and fun for children to be entertain with the playground structure and board games as well as the play room. I was so amazed to see a baby chair and formula . That’s a plus for me. My infant loved having breakfast with us. Very home warming and quiet neighborhood. I will definitely be staying here again.

Sharalee was very communicative when I had questions, was never over-bearing, and provided several excellent (and delicious) recommendations for local hot spots to try. The house was wonderful! It really cooled off during the night, so pack some warmer things in the evening. The house was easy to access (as far as area of town), the driveway was HUGE, and the chickens were awesome! I thought they would be louder, but we never heard them from inside. We were on a vacation, so we decided to splurge on a rental car and had NO doubt that the car would be safe overnight. We had zero issues and would recommend this place to anyone looking to escape the RIDICULOUS hotel prices in this area.

Sharalee was super responsive, easy to work with and it’s very easy to see why she is a Super Host. It’s our new home away from home. It books up quick! Don’t think twice- it may not be there!"

Group trip","This listing was exactly as stated and inline with all the past reviews. Overall stay was excellent. The house is very large and roomy. Having a bathtub and separate shower is great when trying to get ready quickly especially when 3 girls are in the family. Beds are comfortable, lots of games, WiFi works well, my daughters (10 & 11) loved the trampoline. Washer/dryer was key as we wore a lot more clothes than normal, because it was winter time. Collins Lake a cool place to check out, really empty during weekdays (playgrounds, walking trails and fishing). Boreal and Woodward (snowboarding and trampoline and jumping pits) are also fun spots but a couple hours out, but a really nice drive. Great experience and wonderful place to stay. Mahalo Sharalee!!!"

Stayed with kids","The Chicken House was absolutely perfect for my family. The home is very spacious and comfortable. Our five young children kept busy in the backyard, jumping on the trampoline, playing on the swing set and gazing at the chickens. It was the perfect location for us to stay and visit family in the area. It was also centrally located to Bel Air, Antonio’s Quick Lunch and Starbucks - I appreciated the convenience. Check in was a breeze and Sharalee is very responsive! We will certainly be visiting the chicken house again.
Oh and I noticed a few reviews about security cameras. We didn’t mind the security cameras.… we told our children that Santa was watching them and it helped to keep them on best behavior…if anything they were a perk to us."

Chickens out in the backyard are adorable! Wish we could keep one! Lol, everything was included in the kitchen and was enough to celebrate early Thanksgiving. Everything is close by, Grocery Store (WinCo), Starbucks, fast foods, restaurants, all these you can find under 8 mins of driving. Quite neighborhood overall! We really miss it, this is one of the best AirBnB in Yuba City, CA. Thank You again for taking care of us Sharalee! We truly appreciate you for being awesome from start to finish! We will return again!!!!

Stayed with kids","Nice open layout house with activities. We really appreciated the inclusion of a ping pong table and foosball to help keep the kids occupied. Beds were really comfortable, and each room has a TV with a Roku. The internet was speedy and didn't cause any issue, especially important as I had to unexpectedly remote in to work. There's plenty of room for parking, and the neighborhood is quiet.
The kids also enjoyed the swings and trampoline, and feeding the chickens (though the novelty wore off quickly).
Host was accommodating and communicative. When an issue came up, she helped out.
I saw another review that mentioned the AC, so I may as well address it. The AC stopped working the day I arrived, but the host sent an AC repair tech out immediately who fixed the issue and serviced the entire system. After that, there were no issues, no concerns about making changes to the temperature, and the cooling capacity was very adequate."

Stayed with kids","Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Chicken House! Sharee was nice and the size of the house is a great value for the price!
We are rounding up to 4 stars with respect to this being a new airbnb, but it's more like a 3.75 right now due to the issues below:
- Questionable black/dark towels and bath mats.
- Dirty floors (even in the bathrooms) and no mop.
- Random stuff like crayons/water bottles found in the corners of the rooms/under the sides of the beds.
- PARENTS: There is a steep set of steps from the dining room to the game room and no baby gate.
- No dining table, only counter stools.
- They have weird rules about turning the AC off every few hours that don't seem true and aren't mentioned in the listing.
Things we did enjoy:
-Power-strips next to all the beds
-Relatively comfy beds
-TVs with Roku in every room
-The location
-The price
-Fresh chicken eggs to try (we ended up not trying them, but it was a nice touch)
-Quick responses from the host
-Game room
-A large yard with a playground
-A nice dishwasher and all the kitchen utensils we needed.
-Cute Chickens
I would 100% recommend this stay with a few changes and some extra transparency."

Stayed a few nights","Michael was a great host!
On the day of my check in, he had to get a guy to come in and fix the wifi which was done right away, all finished up by the time I reached there. The other guy also offered me some oranges right from their tree, which was very nice of them!
Another thing I appreciated is that after my checkout I had forgotten a candle there, I asked Michael to quickly grab it, which I appreciate. :)
The studio itself is above a garage, there is a lot of space to relax, work, and walk around.
The only thing that I noticed is that there were several bugs, possibly from the house being right next to the river. Besides that, everything was great and this stay was definitely worth it!
Unfortunately I had to cut my stay short due to family, otherwise I would come here again next time I am in the area!"

They went out of their way to make me feel at home and to ensure that I was comfortable. Mike and Mark are very helpful and knowledgeable about the area and were able to help me find things to do in my spare time.
The apartment has everything a traveler could need to feel at home. There is a full kitchen, as well as great area to work from home. The full garden in the back yard is a particularly peaceful and is a nice place to put your feet up and relax during the evening.
The highlights of this property:

-Cleanliness
-Peaceful area, walks on the levy are nice
-Many restaurants within a mile or so."

The property itself is a special place - beautifully landscaped, citrus trees, chickens, ducks, and even a tortoise! Michael is a fantastic host! He's responsive, and went above and beyond. One morning he left a small ""care package"" outside the door - with a muffin, some eggs (from the chickens and ducks), and grapefruit. So kind, and much appreciated."

Shelby is a 60lb. tortoise that roams the yard, Cayuga ducks that were babies when I arrived and got to watch them grow rapidly and run around the yard, and chickens which the hosts are willing to share their eggs with you. But most of all the hosts are just awesome. I can not say enough good things about them!!!!"

Stayed about a week",Michael’s place is spectacular it’s more than what’s even advertised. So quiet and very large with high vaulted ceilings. He made me feel so comfortable I’d have to say my favorite place I’ve stayed as a travel nurse I would love to stay there again when I come back to the area.

It felt like we were right at home. I really enjoyed that the guest house had a kitchen so my family and I can make home cooked meals ! Michael also went out of his way to make sure we were okay each day, and that meant so much to me!!"

Stayed over a week","I couldn't ask for a better place to stay. The hosts were amazing, warm and friendly and made us feel welcomed . The property has many types of plants, flowers and trees and are grouped together perfectly. We had fresh grapefruit right from the tree (the best I have ever tasted) fresh eggs from the hens and homemade cookies that they made for us! The airbnb is very nicely done with special added touches and very comfortable. The shower is great, the bed really comfortable, and plenty of room for us all. There is a Tortoise named Shelby who is nice and friendly, and their dogs Toby and Lily are really sweet too. I will definitely be back to stay again."

The place was spotlessly clean upon my arrival, and check in was simple. There is a secure gate with a key pad and a clicker to use. It is a great place for long-term stays. Michael answers his texts very promptly and is good about giving any communication heads-ups about anything that might concern or pertain to the guest."

Stayed over a week","This is the best airbnb I have found in the area for the price. I have bounced around between three airbnbs this last five months and this stay has exceeded my expectations. The personal touches have been given exceptional attention and made for very comfortable surroundings. The suite is situated above a stand-alone garage, so you have a private hideaway to yourself. The shower drains away the stresses of the day with a perfectly-pressured shower head to unfold an evening of relaxation. The bed has given me a good night's rest without waiver throughout this whole month. You just can't beat the price with what this place offers."

It was extremely clean, attractive, and had everything a person would need for a longer stay. And Michael, the host, is one of the nicest people you'll meet. He let me mail a birthday gift for my son to his address and he even made my son a piece of birthday cake. He went above and beyond! You will not be disappointed if you book this property!"

I appreciated all the artistic details inside and outside of the place. I so enjoyed the beautiful views of the sunrise and sunset. The place felt spacious, the kitchen had everything I needed to cook, and the bed was luxurious! I loved the chaise lounge and although my friend (and her dog) were not able to join me in the end, I could definitely see our returning in the future, and using it for a second sleeping option. What a lovely garden!"

Stayed with a pet","We (wife, two dogs and myself) stayed here one night. We were not sure if we were to park on the street or use the driveway to the side yard. The side yard gate was open, so we parked behind it. Check-in and entrance was simple and easy. The small square-footed was perfectly fine for us. We unloaded our bags, helped the dogs get situated, and went out to dinner. Upon return, another vehicle was parked behind the side-yard gate, so we parked on the street.
We enjoyed using our phones to cast videos to the living room tv. The beds were super comfortable. We slept great! Around 2am, the dogs needed to do their business, so I took them out front. It would have been much nicer to use the backyard, but there is not access from inside the house to the backyard.
Centrally located, it was easy to pick up coffee and breakfast in the morning. We cleaned up, checked out, and went on our way!
We have already booked another night for Mother's Day! Thank you!"

I loved how Kara's house had everything we needed and just enough tasteful decoration to make it homey but zero clutter. Very comfortable beds with quality linens meant we slept extremely well. Everything was so clean there was none of the ick-factor one has in even some decent hotels. Kara's house will be our home away from home when visiting Northern California. Thanks a million Kara!"

The air conditioning was excellent. I felt safe walking my dog in the neighborhood. I thought the plethora of chickens and roosters throughout all of Yuba City were hilarious.

She was kind and helpful and even gave us a great dinner spot (casa lupes- they make their own tortillas!!). The entire place was clean and felt very secure. I would defiantly stay here again next time I’m back in the area. The noise from the roosters was not a problem. They were fun to see wondering about. THANK YOU KARA!!"

But Kara was extremely communicative, and the place was indeed very clean for the very few minutes that I was there. Again, not Kara's fault, entirely mine in that my work called me elsewhere and I didn't have time to contact Kara to make other arrangements. If am in the area again, will likely attempt to stay here as it looks like a nice place."

She didn't have to do that. She could've given it to anybody else and been paid right away but she didn't. Because of that, I was able to spend a night away with my daughter so we could reconnect and I will always be forever grateful for the host she was. With that being said, Thank you so very much, kara."

Kara was very good at communicating and even got a pack-n-play for my son so that our stay would be more comfortable. The space was nice and the beds were super comfortable. There are chickens and a rooster in the neighborhood, but they didn't bother us-- they seemed quiet all things considered. Maybe because it was winter and so the sun didn't come up until later, but I didn't even hear the rooster until around 8am. It was also kind of fun for my kids to walk outside and see free roaming chickens. It was a great stay, would recommend."

Can’t go wrong, fair price and beats staying at any motel by far. Walking distance to the happy Viking and sutter brewery. Place was clean and in quite neighborhood, would stay again if I ever got another call out there."

The kitchen has everything you would need if you decided to cook a meal. They have a Keurig coffee maker too.
The weather was cold and rainy during our trip. Otherwise, we would have used the pool. The ping pong table and darts were a fun option since enjoying the outdoors this trip was not.
We will stay at this Airbnb the next time we visit family in Yuba City."

The pool is SO FUN. We felt like kids going down the water slide.
We’ll be back with our kiddos because this is the perfect house for a summer getaway.
One note- if going to a concert in Wheatland, make sure you plan to drive or hire a car ahead of time. Can services, Lyft, and Uber are sparse at best. We waited 1.5 hours for all three of those services and got nothing. Ended up just driving ourselves and glad we did because the Uber line to leave the concert was super long and not moving + that venue is literally in the middle of nowhere."

It’s a huge beautiful yard with a pool that even though not heated was the perfect temperature. Bring floats from home and enjoy the yard. It even has a tv outside and everything was in working order. Ping pong table, pool table and darts in the garage made for fun evening activities. It was incredibly hot outside but the house was kept very comfortable with the thermostat set at 68. The kitchen was well equipped and I made a full breakfast for everyone without any trouble. I can imagine small children would have a blast running around in the huge yard and the pool is fenced for safety. The house had child proof locks on cabinets and the floors would be great for a child to roll around in one of those baby walker thing’s. We wanted to book again for a weekend next month but it’s already booked so don’t wait and reserve it now."

Also streaming netflix etc. on the huge living room TV. 5 stars on every single category (except location) but who cares when you have a family staycation with such a beautiful home and amazing host?! My girls loved the friendly neighborhood kitty that hung out in the backyard. Beds were super cozy, AC worked amazing and best of all…the host was so responsive with any potential issue or question we had. Oh, and LOTS of DoorDash options even though there’s not much around.

A very friendly kitty 😺 entertained the kiddos as it hung around out back. There are lots of bugs from all the agriculture around. Love this home and will be returning next time we venture this way. The host Ved was very accurate on responding and very welcoming. 😊"

Stayed with kids","This property is absolute perfection. If I could give it more than 5 stars I totally would. All the amenities you’d expect at a fancy hotel with the convenience and space of an Airbnb. I brought my parents, niece, and three year old son and we all enjoyed the pool so much! The pool isn’t heated but it was very comfortable without being too warm! The backyard and the patio were so wonderful. We loved swimming and then watching tv on the back patio after. The host was so gracious and welcoming. The house itself and yard were spotless and beautifully decorated. I’ve stayed in many Airbnb’s and I can say this is by far my favorite property! I can’t wait to come back!"

Pool table, ping pong table, and darts. We all played everyday. The back patio area also has a tv and they had blankets and beach towels on the side. It was perfect for watching movies at night. The pool is not heat but our kids didn’t mind. We went in on Easter weekend and Ved’s place had hid Easter eggs all over the house with some hints & snacks. My kids enjoyed. Overall you will not be disappointed. They went above and beyond and my family had a wonderful weekend."

There are three of us, and we were comfortable the entire time, plenty of space. The three full bathrooms were awesome, and the kitchen was very well laid out. We definitely appreciated the multitude of TV's throughout the house. The location was nice, very suburban, and very quiet. I would highly recommend this for other contractors looking to work in the area, as the Abnb's offer a much better value, especially to the local motels. I do all our travel bookings, and we're definitely adding this house to our list of preferred places."

Group trip","More than a nightmare, this host does not upkeep his appliances (freezer was leaking iced water and held back with a rolled up frozen towel), a cockroach in the sink (see photo sent to Airbnb) AC was not working downstairs, host did not have a working messages on a contact number.
When the repair guy did not turn up on time I called airbnb to complain.
In the middle of the complaint the AC repair guys arrived so I REQUESTED “Jose’ at airbnb agent “to withdraw the complaint, did he understood- yes he understood he said - the reservation will NOT be cancelled.
I asked Jose what is the outcome of a complaint would be and he told me they CANCEL the booking and refund the money.
As we were 3k mls away from home and attending a 7-day wedding events I did not want to have to leave so made sure he understood to withdraw/cancel the complaint as if I never called.
Airbnb employee Jose said he would make sure that the booking is not cancelled. Of course they record every phone call so I hope they follow up and listen to our call.
AC was repaired and went off to our wedding function at this moment 5pm.
Lo and behold at 6.22pm I got a text from the host “Johnathan” - “airbnb has cancelled your reservation so please leave the house immediately”!! Wow
It took me 3 hours of begging and groveling to get the host to agree to us staying there. This “Superhost” showed no humanity and no empathy. I explained the cancellation was a mistake but he would not renew it.
He then charged me the correct amount for the three remaining days but changed his mind and then made me rebook with 9 adults (we were only 6 adults) for a unwarranted higher $ amount and plus also charged $380 for the first night.
I am now out of the property and speak the truth about it and the host.
We are trying to get all this resolved with Airbnb.
The place was a shambles. I have never stayed in a rental of this quality.
I sent photos of the following to Airbnb-
The bedding was stained, the pillows were stained, there was a cockroach in the sink, the AC was not working, the freezer was leaking water onto the floor, the bed on the ground floor was creaking every time you turned over when lying on it. The washer had not been emptied, the kitchen was not equipped with good utensils or crockery, just basics, etc.
I would not recommend anyone staying there as the host is not a person with empathy."

Stayed a few nights","Amazing location, super nice house. My biggest complaints are the creaky wood floors so it’s super easy to hear others walking around the house, along with the toilets not exactly being the cleanest. I’d say my top complaint concerns a safety issue involved in the master bathroom. I was attempting to take a shower. When reaching for the temperature adjust, my hand grazed what used to be a soap holder but half was missing. The fact that there was only half there made it have jagged edges, and therefore had cut me a bit.
Overall I did enjoy the security system that was apart of the house, and Jonathan was super attentive to our needs. Would stay here again if given the chance."

The house is huge! and as describe. The only thing that I really don't like is the security deposit of $500. For future renters, be very careful. Make sure to take quick pictures of all discrepancies as soon as you arrived so you won't be charged. Kinda scary since I have found 2 cigarette butts at the patio when we arrived. That can be an easy way for the host to take all security deposit. Overall, we like the experience. We might look somewhere else first due to the security deposit in the future."

And if you look for the lock box code but don’t bother reading further like us about the alarm code. Or if you like to sleep with the room cool but the thermostat is locked so you can’t stand even a sheet and the ceiling fan is off balance and makes noise all night. Rules after rules with threats to lose deposit. Oh yes, the $15 per person charge over two in a FIVE bedroom home. Would I rent from Jonathan again...NO!"

The beds are very comfortable and the home is kept at a pleasant temperature. It is a huge home with great separation of space for a family. We look forward to staying there again.

Stayed with kids","This conveniently located large house is extremely clean and is comfortable for two large families. It has three living rooms including a fun upstairs one that was great for the kids to play video games.
The kitchen is new and nicely done.
Things to bring: soft down pillows if you like those. Also light weight blankets if you don’t like heavy bedspread/comforters.
The large house has super high ceilings and lots of comfy couches. It seems lovingly and thoroughly decorated with bright colors, crown moldings, wall paper strips in cheerful patterns, many kinds of artwork including inspirational messages, nature, ancient Rome, ancient Japan, flowers, city scapes, birds and animals. The Japanese kimono statues in one bedroom were really interesting.
This is a super easy home to stay in if you are spending the days in swimming holes as we did.
Yuba City has a great family swimming are on the Feather River on the upriver side of the bridge and new restaurants like Panera.
Jonathan was A+ to work with."

Stayed a few nights","The good: This house is in a nice neighborhood, it's big, and the beds were comfortable, which I appreciated, with adequate pillows.
The bad was considerable though. This house seemed to be very new to the market and was not really ready to be rented. The cleanliness standard was low for the bathrooms (hair/dirt in all of them we used), and the kitchen pots, pans, stove, even tea kettle were kinda ""bachelor kitchen gross"". We didn't use any of them. The dining room chairs were also really dirty.
We arrived at night, so lot's of time to clean, but when we got there, there was a dishwasher full of dirty smelly dishes. Not cool. They had to enter the unit a bunch for dishwasher repair (which never got fixed during the 5 nights we were there) and they also entered for some mysterious problem with the alarm system. We were there working and were gone all day, but it would have been irritating if we had been vacationing in the unit.
Lastly, the host changed the fees after I clearly rented for 3 people, asked for more money after the fact because I had an ""extra"" person? And, when the problems arose with the dishwasher and alarm, he swapped off of airbnb messaging and went with direct text/phone, which now makes me nervous because hosts do that when there are problems."
