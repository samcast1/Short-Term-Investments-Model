We had a group of 8 and the living room was a little smaller than I thought, but it was very cozy feeling, with comfy couches, so we just cozied in and enjoyed the together time.
Enjoyed the air fryer in the kitchen and definitely took advantage of the dishwasher!
Easy check in and not a long list to check out! Love that!
Nadir was very communicative and friendly.
The area felt peaceful and quiet, but still within close driving distance to anything you could think to do.
Fantastic stay, would stay again!"

The neighborhood was quiet, no through traffic, and was close to many stores. You can tell there was a lot of effort and attention to detail involved in creating this space.

Just outside of hustle/bustle of Tulsa's traffic (but within 10 minutes of the world-reknown ""Gathering Place"" park), this home sits in a small, quiet neighborhood that is slowly being brought back to life. The kitchen is superbly equipped with everything needed to cook a great meal (spices, utensils, coffee, sugar, creamer, etc.). You just have to show up with family and ingredients! Bathrooms have fluffy towels, soap/shampoo/conditioner just like hotels, and the fenced in backyard is perfect for furry friends. The beds and linens are first class as well. Maliha and Nadir are fantastic hosts and super responsive. We will be back!"

Stayed with kids","While I wasn't unsure of the area when first driving in, this home sits on what seems like a private road with other rentals. It felt private and safe.
This home was very well stocked with all the amenities you might have at home. I normally travel with things to cook with but that is not at all necessary at this rental. ALL you would need to cook (knives, small kitchen appliances, cookware, and all the dinnerware) were provided and in great condition. There was even an InstantPot and air fryer available! There were ample towels, toilet paper, and paper towels provided for our large family as well as soap, shampoo/conditioner, and pods for the dishwasher and washing machine. We loved having a washing machine available.
Make sure the shower curtain in the master shower is closed ALL THE WAY before turning the water on or you'll be prewashing your feet 😂 Beds were comfy, games were provided for the kids, and Roku TVs are provided in abundance. Outdoor areas were also cozy and well kept.
We ran into a couple concerns during our stay and when we reached out to Nadir and Maliha, they responded almost immediately. They were so quick to make it right and make up for any inconvenience. They went above and beyond with communication. Would definitely stay again."

Group trip","Nadir was highly responsive and accommodating from the start of the booking process through final checkout. The home was clean and had all of the amenities one would need for their stay from coffee and soft drinks to an iron and towels. Larger groups should expect to potentially share beds if it is more than 5 people (we were a larger group). The parking situation can be a little difficult if you have more than two cars and the location is not the greatest (coming from a Tulsa local). However, the home is a short drive from downtown which was nice.
I would recommend this stay, just would recommend reading the house rules prior to booking so there are no surprises."

Centrally located to have access to many things and attractions in Tulsa Area.
Was tidy and really enjoyed the home and it's privacy.
Large tree's in yard which lends it's hand to beautiful music from nature by birds when you wake up each morning to have coffee on patio. Your in the city but feels like your not because of privacy fence. The shower is a big highlight for me, my tired muscles from driving had relief to enjoy our day downtown Jenks antique shopping. Very enjoyable time for a quick getaway! If you haven't booked go ahead and do so now!"

Shower bench provided. Wonderfully fenced-in deck (access step-free) & small grassy fenced-in, private yard - with table & comfortable arm chairs…w/tabletop fire pit & a string of dazzling lights, for evenings. Nice Grill, as well…but we did not use. We experienced beautiful sunsets! Felt safe. Stephanie is responsive and helpful. Location good. We were there 4 nights…..during which time we visited the Tulsa Zoo, Philbrook Museum of Art, The Bob Dylan Center….all easily reached (by car, of course). Had a great experience at “Maggie’s Music Box” - downtown - Main Street Jenks. Don’t miss it! We highly recommend this AIRBNB!"

It is very modern - from the kitchen to the shower and the decorating and small, great touches everywhere made the place really special. It was too cold for us to enjoy the outdoor space, but it also looked amazing.
We decided last minute to go with an Airbnb over a hotel, and I am so glad we did! Stephanie was immediately responsive when we inquired about the place. If I ever go back to or through Tulsa, I will absolutely try to book it again (if someone else has not already snatched up the dates)!

I am disabled and the place met all my needs, even better than my home. Large doorways and lots of room to maneuver my walker. The shower is walk in and the place even has a shower chair. I felt very safe.

And the view was 5 stars but the photos in the listing really dont show that its right next to the lodge. Middle of the week it was mostly quiet but could be busier on weekends.
The highlight, besides the view were hearing the horses neigh and the lodge dogs that stopped by for a visit! That part was the Best!
We met and spoke with Claudias husband and a very nice man! They have another more secluded cabin with a King bed we might try next time, although I would miss visiting with the dogs! 🐾🐶💕
All in all it was a delightful get away!"

Stayed one night","The view of the lake with the sunrise/sunset alone is worth the trip. The cabin looks like the pics. The host was responsive. I would note the bed appears to be a Murphy bed which could fold up into a cabinet. It's not a king size bed, and there's about a foot gap between the bed and the wall where it would fold up. Not a bad thing, just something guests may want to be aware of. The place was nice and clean, the TV was a streaming smart TV that worked well. Internet worked well. There is an event center next door. We were fortunate enough to book when there were no events planned, so it was nice and quiet. You can ask the host or find when events are booked online, if that's a concern. Again, the location and views are terrific and worth the trip for those :)"

We fished in the pond catching some perch and catfish, and took quite a few photos. I highly recommend this Airbnb. There's no way you so be disappointed!

I didn't notice the review that mentioned it before our stay but future guest may ask if it's been fixed before visiting. Claudia did offer to compensate us for the inconvenience which was very nice. The shower is the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. If it's ever fixed I would definitely stay again. 🙂

The cottage is cute and it’s on a nice piece of property, but there is an event center right next to it that I was not aware of till the day of.

Stayed a few nights","The pictures only offer a glimpse into everything Claudia’s cabin has to offer. It’s more of a hidden peaceful retreat. The cabin has an old world charm and is very cozy. It’s set up much like a studio apartment, having the kitchen, living room and bedroom all in one big space. The shower is large and we never ran out of hot water. We relaxed in the evening with a nice fire outside. It overlooked the little lake below which was reflecting the bright light of the moon. It was really beautiful.
Her Scottish cows were so sweet. We also enjoyed seeing her horses and chickens. While we were out for a walk, we met Claudia’s husband, who was very welcoming and kind. He took a little break from building some horse stables to visit with us. He offered us a tour and shared their story of how they developed this beautiful area. The (rental) cabin sits adjacent to a beautiful venue to which he also built. His craftsmanship and their passion to host others is evident in the all of the little details you’ll experience, which are too numerous to mention. We will be coming back again. Also, check out their beautiful venue if you’re interested in a wedding or large gathering. Their whole place is so special."

With a riverwalk and an awesome downtown area with a lot of cool shops like The Cajun Blackbird, and Tulsa just across the river, we found lots to do!!!

Stayed one night","What an amazing property! My only regret is that I couldn't stay longer. Located on a gated private property, this was a comfortable one-room log cabin on a lake, with a great porch and rocking chairs, well lit at night. The cabin was lovely, with a great kitchen, well stocked and immaculately clean. The bed was very comfortable, as was the seating area. I loved sitting out on the porch with my morning coffee. In mid-August, the humidity was dense but the cabin's air-conditioning was up to the task. Also a great shower!"

She was easy to reach if needed, the place was quiet, quaint, and cozy. My wife enjoyed watching the horses and cows. One of my favorite things to do is to drink coffee as the sun comes up over a lake, and it had been a long time since I'd had that luxury. Thanks again Claudia!"

If a cozy home away from home and view of the lake weren’t enough there are many wonderful creatures and people who are kind and care about the land. Claudia went above and beyond to help us on our trip and get settled. We got to meet their baby calf in the pasture and the horses too. A special thanks to Lisa and Mark for suggesting the donut shop down the road, grateful for that! If you and your traveling companion want to be close to the city but enjoy the country quiet and nature, this is a great choice. You will absolutely enjoy your stay!"

Stayed with kids","For my first time ever staying in an Airbnb I was really impressed with the ease of check-in and with how nice and clean the apartment was. I gave it 5 stars because it is an overall great place to stay. I will say this, and this is not a negative comment for the host, but the parking on the street was a bit annoying as you need to update and pay for parking at a maximum of every 2 hours, due to the fact that it is paid street parking. It is inexpensive at only $1 per hour, just make sure you're not late on paying each hour or else you run the risk of getting ticketed. Lastly. I prefer a traditional type of mattress compared to a memory foam one, not saying this to complain about what they had, it's just my preference, as I found it harder to fall asleep."

Stayed a few nights","I frequently visit Tulsa for work and usually stay at a nice hotel near my office. I was a little nervous about an air bnb based on prior experience, but this one was perfect. Amazing location, great value, well decorated and well appointed and very comfortable. It was even close enough to my usual hotel to grab a drink at the bar a couple of nights. Sunsets on the rooftop became a nice evening ritual. I will definitely stay there again!"

I wasn’t entirely sure about the location of the place since it was a tiny house and the description didn’t fully include what it was but it was just a little shed like building next to a bigger house. It shared the drive way. It was one room with a bed and a kitchenette. Then the bathroom which had the laundry. It was perfect for our weekend stay and our dog was welcomed with a doggy bowl and a toy. The back yard wasn’t enclosed but it was still a big backyard our dog ran around in."

She didn't believe me when I told her how much it was. Folks looking for a rental that is very special should stop looking when you come across this one. We prefer a place that does not allow pets or parties and NO smoking. They even had fresh water and fresh condiments in the fridge. I could go on and on but simply I'll just say - THANK YOU Roi...

All you had to do was ask Google if you wanted to play music or turn on some lights. This place serves one purpose and one purpose only. You’re not going here to vedge out and watch TV. So many fun and kinky items to play and explore with. Would 10/10 recommend!"

Stayed one night","Our first time getting to play in a private sex positive, kink-friendly space. We were already wanting to visit again! And the RR made us wish there were more private adult rooms like this nearby. Amanda & Jake communicated and set realistic expectations for our one night stay. We thought the overall accommodations were top notch—right from the entrance and until we left. Highly recommend!"

No issues finding the place or parking. We are coming back this summer. Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","We truly enjoyed our stay. The place is easy to find, it is near shopping and restaurants. It is extremely clean. The condo complex is dated but once you walk inside you are never aware of that. It is clean, and very modern, the condo is a complete smart home. It is designed for play and fun more than comfort and relaxing. This place has more toys than some dungeons I have been to and by far our favorite was the swing room. We also really enjoyed playing with the floggers the owners sell. We were able to see, feel and decide on what we want to purchase. Should you want to purchase before they will have item waiting when you arrive. We spent most of our time at the Condo only leaving for breakfast. Owners keep the fridge filled with water which was a nice touch. We will definitely be back and the only thing we will do differently is take our own pillows."

Stayed one night","I would recommend this to any friends looking for a fun, adult night away. The hosts were so helpful with everything. I tried to suprise my hubby for our anniversary and everything seemed to be working against me, but they were so kind and helpful. Parking is a little tricky after dark, but it's a simple turn to the right once you enter, then a turn to the left and you have a covered space. They were quick to reply (though they were probably tired of me), everything was clean, thought out and ready for action! Even the fridge was stocked with bottled water. A playground for two adults that never get enough playtime - and my favorite part was in the swing room -because I was inverted.
If you're a fan of Top Gun or just want to try out some fantasy play, do yourself a favor and book this place now.
Thank you for an awesome experience."

The weather was very cold and the house was very cold the first day and night. They should have turned the heaters on sooner. The tv would not get local channels just a personal preference for me.

We appreciate the water bottles and snacks. Having parking right next to the cottage was convenient and felt safe. Lori is very hospitable and helpful. We would love to stay here again if ever in Tulsa.

Having an off street dedicated parking space was great, and the location was very convenient to parks and the main roads to get around town. The cottage was extremely cozy - very comfortable bed and pillows, a lot of street noise but very quiet indoors. The dog run is a great touch if you bring your dogs. Fully functional kitchen complete with thoughtful snacks for guests. We would recommend this place to anyone!"

It’s nice to enjoy a glass of wine at the end of the day out there while listening to the water feature. AND, there's a new fenced area in front of the cottage that is landscaped beautifully and has a woodburning fireplace!
Still the best AirBnB around!"

Finding the location was a little confusing because it’s begins the main house and you access it by driving around the block and up a side street. However our host jumped in their car and showed us the way which was so very kind! There’s a grassy lot down a few steps from the cottage for dogs to relieve themselves and a park right across the street. Great place to stay!

Check in was easy and Lori provided accurate and detailed instructions about parking, as well as a guide to local restaurants that was helpful. There is a lot to see and do within walking distance including the river trail and Gathering Place park. A perfect location for our first time visiting Tulsa. We forgot our folding chairs (to take to the park) and I texted Lori who immediately lent us their chairs. Great hosts and a wonderful place to stay."

There are a lot of great things about the cottage, but the most important one for us is location, location, location. It's 1/2 block from the Tulsa River Trails where we rode bikes and took walks with our dog, Lucy. There is a huge park (Veterans) right across the street for Lucy to get some additional exercise. Grocery stores, coffee shops, and eating places on Cherry Street are literally just minutes away. We will definitely come back a 3rd time in the future!"

Stayed one night","my boyfriend and i loved the dome, or just the three ponds community in general. we had checked in a much later time, so finding the dome felt like a scavenger hunt, but the instructions and signs helped a ton. EVERYTHING was just as described.
my favorite part was the shower (or the farm, the animals were so sweet and lovely). i never knew i would need an outdoor shower, it was so relaxing. there are two or three other airbnb’s on the premises, so you may run into other guests, but we didn’t have a problem with that.
the only ‘bad’ thing i can say is that there was a spider in the corner of the shower, along with a spider egg on the shower curtain (i’m just a wuss when it comes to spiders).
if you’re thinking about staying here, do it!!!! joe was an amazing host. i will be booking again :)"

The quaint Sunset Dome was much more functional than I anticipated, also! The two chairs that sit next to the fire are UNREAL, and look over just one of the pretty ponds they have to offer. Equally great are all the hammocks that lie along the trails. An absolutely wonderful stay that I will most certainly reserve again!
Also, if you’re lucky enough to get the pitter-patter of some rain during your sleep and stay, you’ll never forget it! Pure Bliss :)"

Although we didn’t use the kitchen at all it was fairly primitive. Appliances are basic and aged but everything works. Pretty sure the countertops were painted plywood of which the paint was peeling off. It’s a duplex and you can clearly hear the people conversations in the unit next door so obviously they could hear ours. Bed mattress was comfortable and the bathroom was clean. Check in and out was easy.

Stayed one night","As a couple this is a great stay, minor cons. We were only left with a quarter roll of toilet paper so we had to go buy some, the toilet and shower could have been cleaner but there was cleaner available for us. The shower curtain was too short and unfortunately flooded the bathroom after one shower, but there were extra towels and rugs to clean it up with. The location is great and felt safe but the home was definitely not as nice as pictured, it was just a bit dated with bad worn down floors and lots of dust / cobwebs and the decor didn't fully match the pictures. When entering, the first thing we noticed was the size and a pair of dusty foot prints on the table as off it wasn't wiped down. An unpleasant smell in the bedroom as well. There was only one TV in the living room, it is not as big as the one pictured and there were issues with connecting that to the Wi-Fi but that was resolved. The washer and dryer were great to have and everything worked efficiently and properly!"

Stayed over a week","I specifically asked about this location knowing I was going to be staying alone. I was told inaccurate information about who I would be sharing the house with as a duplex. I wanted to make sure I felt safe and comfortable, instead was left feeling anxious and that I couldn’t relax. I travel as a vendor and wanted to be able to come back after a long day to feel comfortable and be able to unwind, that did not happen here. Along with feeling unsafe, the fridge handles are broken off, the light by the back door didn’t work even when we changed the light bulb, the mattress was a different mattress from what was pictured and extremely uncomfortable and close to the floor. Being a female with her own business, you would think this host could be more understanding and up front with fellow lone women travelers."

Stayed with a pet","Christina was very kind, always had quick response time to any questions or concerns my wife and I had, and was very generous and flexible. House was a bit on the old side- creaky as you walked around, and doesn't have a back door that leads directly to the yard which was a bit inconvenient with my dogs, but was overall a great place to stay, especially for the price, and would absolutely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Christina was an awesome host who responded to me immediately with any concern or question I had. Staying at her air bnb made me want to get my own little house in midtown tulsa and settle down there with my partner. It was beautifully decorated with cool local art finds and a killer little red vintage looking fridge. Everything I needed was at the air bnb like spices, pans, detergent and dryer sheets, even shampoo and conditioner. When I come back to see my mom and sisters I'd definitely want to stay there again."

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed the space. Kitchen was great and coffee, spices, pots, pans, toaster fridge, microwave. Washer and dryer really nice. bathroom is nice & clean.

The reason we didn’t give 5 stars is the mattress. It’s worn out with no support and sits on slats which isn’t good support either.
We are mid 60’s and need more support. Maybe it’s great for younger folks. We don’t have back issues but did after our 3 night stay. The last night we finally put the mattress on the floor. So this is info for older folks or folks with back issues.
If the bed doesn’t matter, it’s a really good place for a fair price."

Stayed one night","I loved the decor, location and sweet home touches she provided. I was a bit frustrated with some miscommunication in terms of a long term rental. I was sent from one side of the duplex to the other in the middle of a snow storm with snow and ice covering the front porch and sidewalk. Once I arrived on the other side of the duplex there was an empty condom wrapper next to the bed, a ball of hair/dust on floor, a rag on the dining room table and strong smell of cologne on the sheets like they had not been washed. I alerted Christina about the mess and ice. There wasn't any offer to correct these issues nor make any kind of amends to me. Additionally, upon checking out she blocked me as if I had been a bother reporting health and safety issues."

Stayed with a pet","Overall a less than desirable experience. Stayed 2 short days. The host was constantly messaging me, reminding about rules, expectations, and asking us to clean up the place. Me and my wife checked in late, left early and were still asked by the host to clean up, despite paying $65 of cleaning fees. This included us having to wash dishes, taking trash with us, stripping beds, starting laundry, etc. This house definitely is a money machine for the host and be prepared, you may feel like you work for her. The host also asks that you bring your own sheets and blankets if you have pets to cover her couches. None of the doors inside the unit close or lock correctly and the bed in the bedroom is almost on the floor. How does one prevent pets from moving around the place when none of the doors lock or close and the bed is one foot off the ground. The bed is also unlevel and the foot is higher than the head, which is not comfortable. There's an old moldy shower curtain in the bathroom. Not a huge deal but you'd think with all the cleaning fees and expectations the place would be spotless."

Stayed with kids","The place was nice enough. However, I did not feel very welcome. After booking, I received an email telling me that the place was under 24 hour surveillance and the security company monitoring the home would knock on the door if they felt anything was a miss. Then, when entering the home, there were several copies of the “rules of the house”. Most of the rules detailed how we would be fined if anything was missing, if anyone entered the home who was not authorized, or if we were Tulsa residents. I felt like I was being treated like a child or in a prison. Also, the bed was very uncomfortable, the iron didn’t work, and any time I moved outside I was told that I was being recorded. The whole thing made me and my wife feel uncomfortable during our stay. I understand people can be disrespectful to Airbnb’s, but maybe you shouldn’t assume that everyone’s intent is malicious when staying at your place."

Felisha was a sweet hostess that was available as needed."

Stayed about a week",Clean. Spacious. Plenty of room for several people etc. Not the most comfortable mattresses or the best or most blankets available but for the price I was extremely surprised with the house & it’s cleanliness & functionality! It’s a nice older home that has been updated & well maintained. Plenty of room outside if it’s warm. Extremely gracious && caring host. My ex boyfriend got extremely sick & she had absolutely no problem extending our stay for us. The host was very personable and understanding. Bring some extra pillows & blankets!! Once these mattresses are upgraded this place will be top notch. It’s not in the best part of town but the security really shines here. There are floodlights && cameras everywhere outside so it felt extremely safe & secure. If it’s wintertime bring a space heater for the bathroom. It’s a bigger older house with charm & an updated bathroom but it gets drafty!!

Stayed with kids","What an amazing time we had at Pedro and Emily's place! It is a beautiful, comfortable and fun location to host a weekend with family. There is so much space and everything is well designed and thought out.
We were able to have the Lola's (grandma in Tagalog) playing Bingo at the kitchen table, mid adults playing ""Ticket to Ride"" (provided by Pedro and Emily!) in the den, and the younger kids playing skee ball, foosebal and Switch on the HUGE tv in the game room. The Lola's even used the gorgeous sauna on their first night and had a lovely time.
Lastly, Pedro and Emily were such gracious hosts that communicated with us every step of the way. Everything was clear and friendly. They even messaged us 20 minutes after we checked out to let us know we left our keys in the house! That saved us a world of trouble and appreciate them getting ahold of us.
We will DEFINITELY be using their space again as we created so many memories and had such an excellent time. Thank you!!!"

Stayed with a pet","Maps easily brought us to the correct address in a great Tulsa location. We used the concise directions to enter a well appointed foyer/mudroom. It was a great space to keep our winter gear organized and accessible. The fridge was clean and ready in a kitchen with great counter top space and, yay, filtered water at the sink. All the bedrooms and two full baths are located upstairs so the half bath downstairs was appreciated by family members who range from grandchild to great-grandfather as we reserved our trips up the stairs to bedtime. There were books for that entire age range as well. Board games are a necessity when we gather together and we discovered that we brought duplicate games of those provided in the excellent game room (SKEE BALL). The easy to clean high chair scooted right up to the table so the youngest player could be included. Too cold for the pool but lots of fenced space for the dogs. The hosts responded quickly to any questions we had regardless of time zone."

Stayed one night","I would definitely want to stay here if I had a longer stay in Tulsa. Definitely one of my favorite AirBnB stays. The AirBnB feels like the perfect 'Tiny Home'. It feels private and I loved the backyard. It was so peaceful and clean. Waking up to only hearing songbirds was lovely too. The only walkable thing is Brookside Diner but it is an extremely easy 5 minute drive to all things Peoria street. Trader Joe's, Whole Foods and high-end boutiques. It's less than 10 minutes from other cute neighborhoods/shops etc. I particularly loved the Coffee House on Cherry Street - and the shops there as well.
The only CONS in my opinion:
-the bathroom might be a tight squeeze for some, but really nice big shower and amenities.
-The bed is mostly firm.
-The pillows are small and the stuffing is not smooth. New queen size pillows might be nice.
But despite that, I slept comfortably. Like I said, one of my favorite AIRBnB's. You can tell everything had a thoughtful touch. Thank you Patricia!"

Stayed a few nights","The stay in the suite was fine, and the space had everything I needed. The heater was slightly difficult to keep on at night as the purple light on it was fairly bright, but I'm very light sensitive.
What was frustrating is that I had mentioned upon booking that I didn't have a car, was there for work, and that my co-worker (our VP) would be picking me up and dropping me off each day. I was there to lead leadership planning, company announcements, and our Holiday party. I had mentioned that he would be coming over to work each night so we could plan the next day, but would always leave as there is no way that he would be sleeping there with me. Patricia acknowledged this. However, I noticed a few days ago that an extra $45 charge had hit my work credit card and that something was submitted to AirBnb saying I had another guest, with screenshots of me getting in and out of my VP's car. This was very disappointing, and I wish the host had communicated during my stay to clarify."

The space was beautiful-- by far the best studio I've stayed in. She fit a lot of amenities (full kitchen, washer/dryer) into a small space but somehow kept it from feeling cluttered. There were a lot of special touches, like teas and utensils and spices in the kitchen, an umbrella to use, etc. The outdoor area was beautiful and peaceful. Will definitely stay here again!"

Comfortable bed; big, walk-in shower; small but well-equipped kitchen, and a little sitting area that was comfortable for lounging and computing.

The bed and pillows were comfortable, and the overhead fan and a/c made it very comfortable inside.

Patricia had two dogs that were out in the yard from time to time, however they were very quiet and very friendly.

Stayed over a week","Patricia was a terrific host. This stay was for my daughter who was doing a nearby ballet summer program. Patricia was very kind, and provided a nice, cute, cozy studio with AC near Tulsa Ballet which is what we were hoping for. Bonuses were that she has two dogs in the yard so that was fun. And there are cute rabbits hopping all around the neighborhood. The apartment itself was well equipped and there's even a washer/dryer inside the studio which was a big help to my daughter. The location was perfect to be close to the ballet and there were grocery stores and cafes/etc. very close by. And Patricia was such a sweetheart, she drove my daughter to the airport on departure day...really appreciated that special kindness!
As an added note, it's hot in Tulsa in the summer, very hot. The apartment had great AC so no problem there. Also, Tulsa is super buggy in the summer...think the tropics kind of buggy. Just be prepared if you are traveling to Tulsa in the summer. Patricia has regular fumigation service and bug spray to mitigate this, so much appreciated.
You couldn't ask for a nicer host or a better location for ballet dancers! Thanks again!"

Stayed over a week","Patricia was an excellent host. Her space is so thoughtfully laid out and created/decorated, with the guest’s needs and comfort in mind. Easy access to local things, like a grocery store and restaurants, even by walking which is safe day or night. The Tulsa Ballet is only a ten minute walk, which was my destination daily for classes. Parking for my car was in a driveway just a short distance from the private entry door around the back. This space is attached to the backside of Patricia’s home, but completely separate living areas and separate entrances. In all regards, it is it’s own little efficiency apartment. The decor and appointments are high end and very clean and sufficient. The space is very quiet and the back yard is like a serene garden. The bed is comfortable, blackout shades under curtains, European wall mounted AC unit to set your own temp separated from the rest of the house. Beautiful shower, kitchen with stovetop, microwave and refrigerator. I stayed a month and it felt like my own little home! WiFi is very good as well and the stacking washer and dryer in the unit was super nice to have. If I ever come back, this is where I’d want to stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Let's talk about value for your buck! This place was sparkling clean, smelled great, was cozy and had everything we needed to make us feel at home. We bought groceries and cooked there most days. The suite had various seasonings, cookware, utensils, Tupperware, foil, wax paper, stove, microwave, toster oven, keurig, etc. There was also coffee, hot cider, water...everything you need. Patricia also provided our own air conditioning and heating unit, a washer and dryer and various movie apps on the TV. Oh yea, there was complimentary wifi as well. The view from the suite was of her BEAUTIFULLY landscaped back yard. The walkway was well lit at night time and she has the cutest bulldog named Pumba (I believe), that will sometimes come and greet you if he's outside when you're out there. The water gets very hot and doesn't run out of hot water when you shower and the water pressure in the shower was amazing! All in all, Patricia exceeded our expectations and we will definitely book here again should we ever need to come back to Tulsa. One last thing, the location is in the middle of a whole lot of things to do! Stay here, you'll love it!"

Stayed a few nights",Patricia's place was wonderful. Excellent value. It's an in-law studio suite in the back of the house with everything you could possibly need in it. The bed was comfortable. The shower is great. The kitchen is nice for making small meals in. And it's in a nice quiet neighborhood near a good part of town. Patricia was very responsive to messages and checked in on me shortly after check-in to ensure I was comfortable. I'll definitely look to stay here again the next time I'm in town.

This location was also close to the Gathering Place and the bike path along the river. Super quiet neighborhood. Patricia is a wonderful host who very quick to respond. Great place and I highly recommend to anyone heading to Tulsa."

The kitchen is tight and the sink is small, but I still managed to cook here without much issue. The backyard space is nice as well! I would definitely stay again."

Enjoying the scene of the garden added more character to this peaceful place. They had refrigerated water, coffee, and tea. Love the touch with the washer and dryer. I asked for recommendations for places to visit and Patricia gave me a few place to see. I would highly recommend staying there."

I appreciated thoughtful touches such as a quiet heater, washer and dryer in the unit, comfy overstuffed armchair, good quality towels and linens, etc. I also appreciated the safety features such as floodlights and security camera. I loved the neat, well-kept yard and patio which was perfect for sipping morning coffee. Neighbors were super quiet. Very nice and private. I would definitely stay at this air bnb again. You can tell the host really thought about the guest's comfort and convenience. Most importantly, the place was very clean. A+."

Stayed a few nights","This place was better than expected! Small and cute! About 15 minute Uber to everything. Super quiet. Saw 0 humans! We especially loved the Netflix, washer and dryer, and coffee! Quick responses from Patricia. Be aware that there’s a one person limit and if you have another person it’s a $30 charge per night.. I missed this on the description and ended up paying more than expected and probably could’ve stayed downtown for the same price. Felt a little watched via the security cameras, but at least it’s safe.. although the neighborhood is very calm. We ended up not bringing our dogs, but if we had the yard would’ve been perfect and secure. Bed was comfy. Place was cozy. If you need a simple place to stay, this is perfect."

Stayed a few nights","The studio is nicely decorated and stocked, and the neighborhood is quiet. I stayed two nights. I am giving two stars because the heater did not work and because of poor response. Nighttime temps outside were in the 40s and inside temps were in the 50s. I arrived late on the first night and slept very poorly because of the cold.
I contacted the host the next morning at 9 a.m. to report the issue, and made several other attempts during the day via text and additional messaging. I did not hear back until 7 p.m. that evening, when the host suggested that I press a different button on the remote control. I was out at the time and could not try this new thing until it was late in the evening and time to sleep. The heater was still inoperative.
I sent one more message of status the next morning before checking out. The host replied quickly, apologized sincerely, and offered a full refund, which I accepted with gratitude. Then two days later she sent a message to say that they would not offer a full refund but rather a refund of one night.
In sum, poor communication, slow response, and a broken promise."

There was a game room and pool which was a great way to pass the time, nice amenities. My favorite part was being so close to Cherry Street, walkable to so many restaurants. Started with an amazing coffee at Summer Moon, worked out at Orangetheory, went shopping and ate dinner at Roka (it was hard to choose bc there are so many amazing restaurant options). This place is a hidden gem and a must book for any group. The host was really quick to respond and easy to communicate with!"
