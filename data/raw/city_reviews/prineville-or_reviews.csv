Stayed a few nights","Court St. Cottage is a great place in a quiet neighborhood. It's very spacious. The kitchen is well stocked. There's a lot of space in the house. I liked that there were perfume free options for washing detergent as well as dryer sheets in addition to the ""regular"" detergent and dryer sheets.
It was a very pleasant place to stay. Lots of places to visit in the area. Smith Rock is just a half hour away and the Painted Hills an hour away."

Stayed a few nights",Christian place IS First Class! I was so impressed at the details and the extra nice quality of everything in the house. He was so patient and responsive to all of my silly questions. It had been a long time since I had been on vacation at an Airbnb. We were in a wonderful area and saw beautiful sights. He had great suggestions for us. The house was comfy and cuddly. Our luggage was not at the airport when we arrived and everyone in town was helpful in getting us what we needed. There are many beautiful sights in the area. We saw the stars and a little bit of the northern lights. Mostly by the camera. Make sure you check the whole house out before you decide which room to stay in or to call for help. I didn’t notice he was so well supplied with EVERYTHING because I didn't look at the extra room. How embarrassing. A must stay!

Towels for showering need to be bigger and maybe provide a few more. We did not use any kitchen stuff except for cups. Play structure in back was a hit and I was happy out pup could join us. Location and price were great. We will stay again if needed."

Stayed over a week","Gabby’s duplex was very nice! I enjoyed having all of the amenities of being at “home”, such as a full kitchen, laundry room, large rooms, cozy couch & huge television for movie nights. Gabby was very responsive and answered any question I had almost immediately! I’m very thankful for Gabby letting me stay at her home for over a month while k was working in Prineville.
The only thing to note that wasn’t all that great was being so close to a major roadway (5th Street).. although this has nothing to do with the house nor should it reflect poorly at all with the reviews, but the traffic noise was non-stop! I did get used to it, but it was certainly something to note.
Again, the house was great and I have zero complaints! Thanks Gabby for everything! Oh, and lastly, the neighbors were very kind and it was as if no one lives in the adjacent duplex."

Stayed with a pet","Cris was a responsive and friendly host. He was there to greet us and make sure we had everything we needed and let us park our too tall U-Haul in his driveway. The setting of the Airbnb is gorgeous - surrounded by mountains, fields with cows, and very peaceful and walkable. The inside of the unit isn’t fancy but has nice touches, was clean, and worked great for our stay. The only downside was some noise (voices, TV) coming from the attached house around 10pm, a car driving by the room to the parking spaces on gravel around 2am and voices early in the morning around 6am. I think the walls are just thin so headphones or earplugs could help. If you’re a light sleeper or have noise sensitive dogs it might not be the best fit but otherwise it’s a really cool and unique spot. Thanks for having us!"

Stayed a few nights","I was waiting for my apartment to come available and needed a spot to stay. I wasn’t looking for anything fancy - just somewhere that was affordable in a nice location. The room is on a rather large property that is nestled in a nice neighborhood and surrounded by farm (and trails!!) It was quite peaceful.
The host, Cris, lives on the property.
He was amazing and super responsive and made sure that I had what I needed to stay warm when the temp dropped. He was also very quick to respond to when I locked myself out. I will say, if you want a spa like setting where everything is perfect this might not be the place for you. Things were cleaned but there were a few spiders in spots. It didn’t bother me (they weren’t bad!) but maybe some people. All in all a good stay!"

Stayed with kids","I feel betrayed by reviewers…
We arrived at 7:30pm… no motion light was activated or porch lights on to see which rooms were available but used flashlights to see signs on doors. Upon entering our rooms, we were assaulted by moths and mosquitos. Windows without screens had been left open, allowing these bugs to freely enter by the hundreds. While my husband was unloading the car a dog came barking toward him, turned out to be friendly, but that should be stated as we had small children with us. I text Cris about the bugs and he offered me a citronella candle that was already burned out and insect repellent that we used to kill the mosquitos. At a certain point there was just so many to kill that we stopped even cleaning them up, our room was a graveyard. It was absolutely horrible and we got ZERO follow up or apology for how terrible that situation was. Room badly needs a deep clean as it was very dusty and there was hair in the bathroom. Big difference between rustic and unkept/dated"

Kimberly also thought of the little extras.
Motion sensor nightlights, coffee and creamer, menus for local restaurants, etc.
I would highly recommend staying at Kimberly’s place.
She was an incredible host"

The location was perfect and with plenty of restaurants and shops nearby. The checkin process was pretty smooth. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was spotless, and the entire space was immaculately clean. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing and comfortable stay in Prineville.

Every amenity you could think of was available at the house, well stocked and many comforts thought of. Something that was very pleasant was the amount of daylight that comes into the house. This stay was for a work trip and my partner worked from the house while I was out seeing clients. He felt great working in the kitchen and found it easy to walk to nearby stores. Will definitely stay here the next time I'm in town."

Not only did the house make us feel like the space was our own, we also fell in love with the town. The people were so friendly and there were so many local stores to browse. The best part of our day was always coming home to such a beautiful house. The listing almost undersells the space because our expectations were just exceeded. For two people, the house was plenty of space. Along with that, the host was very kind and generous with the checkout time due to our own fault. We would definitely stay again, for both the town and the home!"

Stayed with kids","Others have mentioned this, but I want to reiterate how very clean the rental is; they clearly take pride on offering a very safe and clean space to stay. Lots of seating in the living room so no one is ever searching for a place to sit. One other thing that stood out--I rent a lot of places, and have noticed that many property owners have moved away from providing things like foil, plastic wrap, paper towels, etc. You will NOT find that at this rental. It's a small touch, but it's very welcoming to know that you don't immediately have to run to the store for these basics. The neighborhood is very nice, and I look forward to renting in nicer weather to enjoy the backyard space."

Group trip","We had an absolutely marvelous stay at Lorrie's cabin. The house was clean and stocked with thoughtful essentials, and the accommodations were wonderful. We can confirm that the space lives up to the listing title: ""Incredible Cabin, Incredible Views"". Even though we had all of our day trips planned out in advance, coming back to the cabin each day was always a highlight of its own.
The view from the back porch is stunning. You get a great view of the valley and reservoir, and it made for a serene morning coffee experience, even on the days that we had a little drizzle. The slight chilliness on the days that we stayed couldn't have worked out better, as it gave us a bug-free excuse to make good use of the hot tub and firepit. On the few clear nights we had, being able to see the stars in all their glory was like nothing else.
We couldn't have asked for a better vacation, and Lorrie's cabin is absolutely at the top of our list when we plan out our next friends' trip! Thank you Lorrie!"

The porch was a great spot for reading in the sun and enjoying the quiet. The cabin itself was very clean, well laid out, and had everything we needed for a relaxing weekend away.

There’s lots of talk in the reviews about the views, so I don’t need to add much to that, but trust the landscape is far more extravagant than words can describe. I read a few reviews that mention the cabin is rustic but I would say it’s far from rustic, it’s absolutely gorgeous and perfectly equipped. Everything is beautiful and there’s lots of attention to detail - we were able to make big family meals and have plenty of room and supplies and loved the small details that really made it feel like home (a big crock pot, plenty of wood for inside and outside fireplaces, etc)
Have to say living in Central Oregon I see beautiful surroundings all the time but was absolutely captivated by this little piece of heaven that is tucked away in the quietness of the high desert. Highly recommend!"

Stayed with a pet","This house has incredible views and is in a really cool location. We enjoyed walking the property and reserve next door and the hot tub. there were thoughtful touches like the horseshoe pit, swing and hammock. But I have to say I did not love the stay because the decor was tired and worn and the house itself did not feel clean - especially the kitchen. The fridge was dirty, cupboards were dusty and full of crumbs. Things were tossed in drawers. The grill was pretty gross and the stove was pretty grungy. I booked this place almost a year out because it looked Incredible and while the location was killer the house itself was pretty disappointing. I'm sure it's hard to keep up with the wear and tear of guests all the time but I've had much better experiences...."

Stayed with kids","A million dollar view... As echoed numerous times in reviews, this view is the reason you're here. Coffee on the porch at sunrise is unbeatable. Sunsets are pretty but sunrise is the real treat so if you book this, please be sure to set your alarm.
We explored a few trails leading away from the property, soaked a little in the hot tub, played a little bit of horseshoes, pool, and darts. The house is as described and while it's a nice open downstairs floorplan, be prepared for lots of noise from the pool table anytime anyone plays. In my opinion, that would've been better suited for in the garage to help cut down on the noise. It's fun when you're playing it; but not when others are :)
There's a nice big kitchen with everything you need to make meals and a large table to eat at inside and a couple more outside.
I would definitely stay here again if returning to the area with friends for a few nights. Those sunrises...beautiful."

The view from the cabin is worth it but there are also a lot of fire road trails around that take you into very private and beautiful country with more epic territorial views. It cleansed my soul. Hot tubbing under the stars and playing pools & darts by the warm fire while it snowed outside was also EPIC! I did not want to leave! Will be back! (Also, super awesome that they allow dogs! Out pup absolutely loved the territory. Sure, dogs can not come upstairs and sleep with you....but that was not a problem for us because our pup already sleeps on his own downstairs in our permanent residence). Thank you to everyone who makes Pete's cabin a beautiful rentable space!"

Watching the full moon rising from the hot tub was something else! The whole front porch setup was so inviting and a special place to spend time as a family. We planned our meals ahead and brought everything we needed, and the kitchen was totally accommodating. We did plan a few activities in local towns during the days, but just being at the cabin was the highlight of the trip. This was one of the first times I came home from a vacation and didn’t feel like I needed another break to recover. It was so serene, relaxing, and peaceful. If you want to unwind and unplug, this is your place. Special thanks to Lorrie for having great communication!"

The area is so quiet too. About the only sounds we heard were the wind blowing and some birds chirping. The house has a pool table, dart board, and a few board games which we loved! We explored Bend (a little over an hour drive from the house) and the town of Prineville (about a 25 minute drive). Overall, we had an excellent time! My one recommendation would be to bring sleep masks with you as the master bedroom does not have any curtains or shades. Sunrise comes early in July!"

We definitely recommend staying here and will remember our time here forever.
The kitchen had most everything we needed. The beds were comfortable. There was plenty of space on the couches, at the dining table, and on the front porch. We could have used more towels and throw blankets -- but overall we had everything we could have hoped for in this gem of a cabin."

Stayed a few nights","Where do I even begin?! This cabin was perfect with spectacular views. Quiet and serene. From watching the sunrise on the porch with coffee to ending the day in the jacuzzi under the sky full of stars. There’s no sounds around except wildlife. Our dogs Harley and Maggie loved running up and down the hills, finding big sticks and watching all the birds and eagles fly. Lorrie and her husband provided all the wood for fires which was incredible. They have huuuuge piles under tarps so they stay dry. The kitchen had all cooking ware ever needed to cook/bake. Lorrie was 100% reachable and responded quickly whenever I had a question. The reservoir was significantly dryer than expected but we still were able to set out our crawdad trap. It snowed on our last day there, and it was such a beautiful sight to watch. The wildlife were out and moving. Never saw any elk but saw plenty of bald eagles and deer. We heard lots of coyotes every night. The cabin has no window coverings or blinds which took some time to get used to but the views from all angles of the house are amazing and you wouldn’t want blinds to cover those views! The cabin is surrounded by BLM land on 3 sides which is amazing because we definitely will be back for hunting season! Thank you Lorrie for sharing your wonderful cabin with us! As a Respiratory Care Practitioner and my boyfriend being a sheriff, this was definitely the perfect escape from the craziness!

Stayed about a week","This place..if you’re undecided on booking I’m telling you, book this amazing getaway! My husband and I travelled from Maryland for our honeymoon and it couldn’t have been better. The views were spectacular. We had some sunny/partly cloudy days and watching the clouds and their shadows travel over the mountains was indescribable. The cloudy days were equally as beautiful, watching the mist and clouds set in the valleys. We happened to be staying during some particularly windy weather, but we were fully entertained by all the amenities inside of the cabin. The pool table was a great time and the fireplace was so serene and relaxing. They have plenty of movies to choose from on those cloudy nights when you can’t stargaze. The week we stayed during was mostly cloudy but we did have some partly cloudy nights and even looking at the stars in gaps around the cloud cover was incredible. The near by town, Prineville, is a 30ish minute drive but a beautiful one. It’s a very cute quaint town with some hidden gems. We went to Debbie Sue’s cafe and dads place, the food was delicious. We enjoyed going by the quant rock shop too, it’s in front of the owners house and his two little dogs are cute and friendly. For grocery shopping, highly recommend the grocery outlet next to the bimart. Awesome prices and good quality food. The kitchen at the cabin was fully equipped for us to make some new meals and had all the spices we needed. The view from the hot tub was so so so beautiful, it was hard to get out. Lorrie was a great host and promptly responded to any questions we had. This place made our honeymoon amazing."

Stayed a few nights","As other reviewers have stated, this stay simply and elegantly exceeds all expectations. Lorrie communicated well and was very responsive to questions. The place was spotless and had amenities a plenty, but that's not what drew us to Pete's Cabin. The magic of this stay is the amazing view combined with its isolation. While many Airbnb's will include 'secluded' or 'private' in their listing, this cabin actually delivers which amps the romance up to 11. There is only one other cabin in the area and it sets lower down in the trees so it was effectively not at all visible and appeared to be unused during our entire stay. With almost no light pollution, stargazers will love sitting in the hot tub at night with all of the lights off watching the milky way and shooting stars. We took full advantage of the expansive lands hiking the cabin's 20 acres along the valley rim and then headed northwest and crossed the barbed wire fence onto BLM lands. While there are UTV trails along the fence that eventually head NW from the property then N across Golden Eagle to a wonderful set of mountains that were well worth the climb (scramble through the rock 'tunnel' and then up to the top). I recommend skipping the trails and just follow the terrain, which you have to do anyway if you want to hike down to the reservoir as there didn't appear to be any defined trails. You can make it down from the horseshoe pit area, but it there are easier ridges to the north for a great hike down and back. Best of all, with all of the hiking we did from the property, the only people my wife and I saw the entire trip was each other. It's liberating spending your stay in complete isolation and few places exist on Airbnb that can deliver an experience that will top this one."

I do suggest, if you have younger children, to bring a few things for them to do. We had a lot of little ones running around and we didn't use the TV at all. There are some board games but small amount. So for children I'd bring more things to entertain them, but for adults it for sure has everything you could ever need!"

The kitchen is fantastic and suitable for all your cooking needs. The view was breathtaking and it was so luxurious to soak in the hot tub as the sun set. The pool table is also a great amenity – we love to play and haven't been able to since the beginning of March, so we were happy to find a great spot with a table :) It was a perfect trip, and we already can't wait to visit again."

It was an amazing experience to wake up with the sun and look from the porch over the landscape.

It’s very therapeutic. All around wonderful stay. Also although the WiFi is limited, they do get full bars of service and data up there so if you have an unlimited data plan it should be just fine! If not, they also have a nice selection of movies and games! We are already thinking of our next trip out there again!"

Note though, that town is a bit further than we expected (even after having read all the reviews that talked about the distance!) and taking the roads down in the dark wouldn't be a good situation so be sure to bring up everything you need for the night. Luckily, almost everything you need is onsite anyway!"

Stayed a few nights","I wanted this to stay an undiscovered gem, but the world must know about Pete's Cabin. The jaw-dropping views will render you silent and still. The rolling thunderstorms with lightning and only-in-Oregon flash rain? FUGGEDABOUTIT
Don't get me started on the stars from the hot tub, the sound of the wind coming down the canyon or the owls at night and coyotes celebrating the moon. And that is on top of the incredible craftsmanship of the cabin itself. From the beautiful furniture and woodwork down to the vintage pool table and horseshoes. If you want to escape into the smell of campfire and the comfort of a french press, Pete's Cabin is a mustie!
My husband and I woke up on our last day with a choice: either we commandeer the place and they have to send a swat team to evict us (kidding obviously) or we rush into town and ask if it's available. Lorrie and Chad got back to us right away! We worked out the detail with Lorrie, (who was out of town visiting her grandchildren, btw. She is an angel) procured provisions and headed straight back to the hammock and furnished binoculars. We soaked in our last night with both indoor and outdoor fires, bbq'd on the grill and watched the sunset from the balcony. This was our first Airbnb and I am now hooked. The bar is set very high with Pete's. I don't know if anyone could match it."

Stayed a few nights","This place is so special! Our family just loved it. Lorrie is a great host and has thought of everything to make Pete's Cabin the wonderful place it is. Where to begin...the spectacular view from the delightful and comfortable covered porch (with its amazing hammock that I never wanted to leave); the full kitchen (as well as the outside gas grill) with everything we needed to make amazing meals and then enjoy them together at the dining table; comfortable, beautiful, and functional furnishings (with stories to tell); WWII pool table was put to good and fun use, as was the dart board in the garage and the horseshoe pit down the trail. We took turns on the swing (couldn't help but recite Robert Lewis Stevenson to my now-grown daughters-lol) and watched shooting stars from the hot tub at night. It was such fun sitting in front of the great fireplace, telling stories and playing games. Nice linens, comfortable bedrooms, and we were all crazy about that downstairs shower! It was the perfect vacation. Thank you, Lorrie!
Highest recommendation. A+++"

Stayed a few nights","The location is stunning. Just prepare for the remoteness and maybe plan to get there and stay there. The road from the base up to the house is winding, with quite the drop off on the side of the road - so be sure to get there in daylight! Fortunately there weren't many other cars at all during our visit so we just drove really slow! :)
Bring your own pans to cook in. Most is older non-stick, other than one metal one. Hot tub was off & ice cold when we arrived, had issues with internet but they were VERY helpful to tell us how to get that going! Apparently there was a power outage the day before. That said, I would think they would have gone to the house the morning of our check-in (since check-in isn't til 4pm) to make sure everything was in working order, and hot tub was on since they live in town. At this price I would expect more than 1 tv as it is a very remote location (30 min into small town of Prineville). If you need to write a book, or music this would be an amazing place to be. I would not suggest bringing small kids here though and the hot tub needs to have the steps secured to the deck, and a railing should be put in place. Seems like an accident waiting to happen. That said - sitting in the hot tub watching the sunrise/sunset is an amazing experience and I'm very glad we went!"

The living room sofa is super comfortable! And the pool table was a huge hit. We loved being able to relax in hammock and hear all the wildlife surrounding us.

Stayed a few nights","What an incredible listing! Do not pass up the chance to experience this slice of heaven! There were four of us that stayed at the cabin for a relaxing weekend and our expectations were exceeded by leaps and bounds. We felt completely secluded and euphoric getting to watch the sunrise and sunset form the beautiful porch and hot tub everyday with outstanding views in every direction. The listing itself was comfortable and equipped with everything we needed for our stay. Lorrie and Chad were friendly and easy to communicate with, making this Airbnb one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of staying at. Thank you for sharing your home! I cannot wait to come back."

Stayed about a week","This cabin and location are just beyond wonderful. My girlfriend and our two older dogs stayed here for a week and we were so sad to leave.
The views are indescribable. The air, scenery, secluded nature of the area, wildlife kept us dazzled the entire time.
Sitting by the fireplace on chilly nights, watching the sun go down while enjoying the hot tub, and taking little hikes while still on the property was so amazing.
The cabin itself was so cozy and comfortable. It felt like our new home for the week.
Lorrie was quick to respond back when we contacted her and was very helpful.
Great hosts for a great cabin.
We will definitely be back."

No issues with check in or check out. I would most certainly recommend this house to anyone looking to stay in the Prineville Reservoir area. Bring groceries and toiletries as the general store a few miles away is very limited."

This place is a gem if you're looking for a laid back central Oregon experience. We were and we loved it.
Its a bit out of the way if you need to stay connected but if your goal is to be out of the way for a few days, it's perfect.
The one bummer was AT+T doesn't service the area, so we were forced to unplug for a few days without knowing in advance. Stressful as a small biz owner but otherwise would have really enjoyed it.
Would love to return in the winter."

Stayed a few nights","This place is princely. It was such wonderful breezy weather with the superb hot tub just like the picture. We were very comfortable and the teenagers and my husband loved challenging each other at the pool table. We made our way to the water on foot one evening - hard scramble down for 15 minutes and harder climb up for 25 min, but doable. The other day we drove to the picnic area about 10 min away by car. We also walked to the marine store which had very minimal supplies, Folgers coffee was all she wrote, ha ha. That was a 50 min walk down and back up the hill a tough hike in the sun, but good exercise. I saw a golden eagle on this hike so it was well worth the work. An excellent stay, with a cabin with very cool architecture and beautiful kitchen. Remote and calming!! I highly recommend this place!"

Stayed a few nights","This house was better than we could have imagined. 6 of us stayed here for Memorial Day weekend. As someone who loved good design and interior decorating I was really impressed. I really loved all of the hand woven throw pillows and interesting accessories around the house. This house is relaxing and inspiring!

This place is a ways from the town of Prineville so you will want to double check you have all your supplies before settling in for the night. Also, if you like to sleep-in late bring an eye mask because the AM sunshine is bright but waking up to the view is unbeatable. Remember to keep the door closed at night because we had an incident with a potato bug that was fairly traumatic for one individual in our group who didn’t appreciate it landing on his foot, good thing some of us were experienced in handling large bugs!

We spent our mornings relaxing on the porch, waking up slowly and evenings playing games and the BBQ. We took one day to hike Smith Rock and have lunch in Bend—we thought we’d go back to Bend the next day but ended up relaxing at the house all day. I would love to stay here again, maybe bring my parents up here next time for a family getaway. I enjoyed reading through the guestbook in the house, my favorite quote I found was “We may have been in the city far too long, and I’m going to have to give this some thought—but I can’t remember feeling this comfortable with windows uncurtained at night, until now.” Thank you Lorrie and Chad for letting us city folk stay in your amazing home.

Stayed a few nights","Lorrie's place is absolutely unreal. The stunning views of the Prineville Reservoir alone are enough to warrant a five-star review. Taken with the immaculate, spacious, and comfortable ranch-style cabin-- the experience is equal to that of the best Airbnb listings in the world.

Weekend favorites included: hot tubbing while watching the sun rise over the high-desert hills, eating a home-cooked breakfast on the sun-soaked deck, exploring the rugged beauty of the reservoir and it's red-dirt roads, playing games of pool with good company in the living room, and watching ""3:10 to Yuma"" while huddled around the fireplace, feeling like we ourselves were living in the western.

There wasn't as much as a hiccup in the entire weekend, and that is due to Lorrie's hospitality and a crystal clear set of instructions for how to best enjoy the cabin."

Stayed a few nights","We wanted a secluded getaway and had no idea how secluded we could get! This was the perfect weekend spot- cozy, intimate and offered all the amenities we were looking for. The views from the hot tub, and from anywhere in the cabin, were breathtaking. We played pool, made some dinners in the open kitchen, sat and ate breakfast on the covered porch and relaxed on the leather couch.

We talked about coming back with friends, but we have decided to keep this one a secret and make it an annual trip to get away from it all and celebrate our anniversary.

You might want to bring your own lighter, to get the fire going. Also, if you are not a fan of bright morning sun, bring an eye patch or a t-shirt to cover your face, as there are no curtains.

This is a MUST for the ultimate ""do nothing"" weekend."

A larger group of us spent a long weekend in this beautifully built and furnished cabin overlooking a picturesque canyon. Aside from the breathtaking private view, the cabin was immaculate upon arrival, fully stocked with everything needed to cook all meals, the beds were very comfortable, and there was plenty of firewood stocked for fires day and night. We relaxed in the sun and under the covered porch, enjoyed the hot tub, the outside fire pit, and the peaceful silence. I would recommend this listing to any group small or large looking for a peaceful retreat from the chaos of daily life. Lorrie and Chad were very helpful from start to finish in the process and I look forward to returning in the future!"

Group trip","Barb is an A-List host and her place is spectacular. Meticulously clean, warmly inviting, and multi-faceted. Many different aspects to this home/grounds/lake. There's something here for everyone - great gathering places - a gigantic game room that sets the standard for game rooms (away from the living spaces so the younger, rowdier crowd can't even be heard) - and many places for privacy. Every morning the men in our family got up early for a pre-dawn fire . . . and everyone stayed up late by the fire, watching the stars. This has got to be one of the best spots in Central Oregon for a large group. When we first arrived, the road seemed a bit close but as soon as we stepped inside, walked through to the front of the home where the vista of Ochoco lake fills the entire living room, we never gave it another thought. Highly recommended."

Birthdays and Barb even left them a sweet gift and provided a welcome basket
with snacks!
The house itself is beautiful! It is very well taken care of and spotless! There is so much to do at this house that all ages will be entertained! We had 3 generations and everyone had a blast! Often times you see pictures of a home which look great and then you arrive only to be disappointed. This house will NOT disappoint! The pictures do not lie… it is awesome!!
The game room is set apart so that people
can be loud and the rest of the house really doesn’t hear them.

Every evening we all gathered at the fire pit for smores and laughter and a fantastic view towards the lake. The game room provided fun when we needed to get out of the sun.

Group trip","This house is amazing !! As a long time vacation rental person , I can say I have never been to a house so well stocked and with so much to do! Games, arcades, puzzles, outdoor games and plenty of extra tp, garbage bags , etc….. Great place for a group to just hang out together without needing to leave! You do need to know the water level is significantly lower than the current pictures depict. The dock has been moved down a rocky hillside (appx. 75-100 yards) to be in the water. You cannot see it from the deck. This was a big deal for us because we had my elderly parents who we knew would be unable to navigate to the water , but we thought they could at least watch their grandchildren play in the water ……unfortunately this was impossible. So….. if this isn’t an issue for you, then this place is absolutely perfect! Oh, and no need to run into town for your morning latte , there is a fully automatic espresso machine complete with beans !!😍"

Kayaking and playing the many yard games available. The gameroom was a huge hit! It was a great place for a small family reunion.
We did have one issue, but Barb was really helpful and on top of it and went out of her way to try to solve the problem. Thanks, Barb!
We were bummed we couldn't get our boats in, but we did know that ahead of time, since Barb made sure to inform us of the low water levels. The lake did have a lot of algae in it. Not sure if thats normal for Ochoco, or if its the time of year or low water levels. It was still fun to swim.
The house was amazingly organized, which we loved. It also had a great layout that allowed the grandparents to go to bed early while everyone else stayed up playing in the gameroom.
All in all, we had a very nice stay."

Group trip","What a wonderful location! With private and easy access to the water, kayaks & paddle boards were included, great views of the surrounding wild life. There is nothing but nature on the other side of the reservoir making waking up and drinking a cup of coffee or an espresso and taking in the early morning view a must. Barb is an amazing host, the best I have ever had! She answered all my questions and concerns quickly, she sent us a list of all things provided in the home ahead of time and even informed us of activities that would be happening around Prineville during our stay. The house was loaded with every piece of cookware we needed and with games and outdoor recreational equipment to keep our group busy, we barely left the property unless we were in the water. Dock access was private and the neighbor was nice and friendly. The house included a few surprises that warmed our hearts and gave us a good laugh. We appreciated the basked of goodies Barb left us, there were chocolates by all our bedsides, and the small wooden box in the living room (next to the guitar and binoculars) gave us all a giggle!
One of the best weekends we've ever had and we'll never forget this thanks to Barb! We hope to book again next year!"

Location is epic too, wonderful lake views from the home with ducks, geese & loons all around. Fishing was also a blast both from the dock and from the provided kayaks & SUP’s. Would love to visit again when the water is up and warm enough to swim."

We went with two families with teenagers/college age kids for Christmas and made the best memories. Super easy road access, open concept great room with a dining table large enough for 14. Large windows overlooking the water. Completely inventoried list of the kitchen with corresponding numbered cupboards. Heated floors in the bathrooms. Comfortable beds, plenty of extra linens, lots of lighting. Game room is amazing - has it's own bathroom and kitchen. Host provided a nice variety of drinks in the cooler as well as some snacks. Super easy check out. We cannot wait to come back."

The A/C is amazing, the house is full of fun games to keep everyone entertained, there are extra picnic benches, there is a pontoon boat, and so much more...everyone that stayed wanted to at some point come back again. The view is breathtaking, and the lake is very isolated. ALSO, Barb is a fantastic host. Easily the best host I've had on Airbnb. She was responsive, kind, helpful and left us some really wonderful treats that made us feel at home. Again, I HIGHLY recommend renting this house."

Stayed with kids","Our group consisted of three different families and two separate adults, and EVERYONE was thoroughly impressed by this rental. First off, it was absolutely spotless when we arrived. There was more than enough room for each group to feel comfortable and have their own space. The living room was decorated for the holidays, which gave it a lovely, festive feel. The lake was frozen and beautiful; the kids enjoyed breaking the ice and exploring the shoreline. The beds and pillows were very comfortable, there were more than enough bathrooms to accomodate everyone's needs, and the kitchen was spacious enough to have multiple people moving through it at the same time without too much inconvenience. This was especially important as we cooked in the kitchen for every meal of our stay, save one.
For families with children, the walk in closets are HUGE in a couple of the bedrooms. We actually had a blow up mattress in the master bedroom closet to make it into a seperate bedroom for the kids. This easily could have been done to some extent with the other two main floor bedrooms as well.
It's an expensive listing, to be sure, but you definitely get what you pay for. We are interesting in coming back in the summertime to make more use of the lake. Overall, it is definitely a 5-star listing."

Group trip","I'm not sure what I loved the most...Barb or the house! Both were exceptional! First of all, she knew I was celebrating my 50th birthday and before our arrival she put up a birthday sign, left out a few snacks and even a cute birthday gift! I was so pleasantly surprised. Every time I texted Barb through the Air B&B App she replied almost immediately and was so helpful in answering our questions. I just can't say enough about what a great host she is! Now...on to the house. Gorgeous! Everything is first class and so beautifully done. Very comfortable and sparkling clean. The beds are very comfortable. The kitchen is gorgeous and is so organized with everything labeled as well as spices and other items for our use if we needed them. Oh...and can I just say the 3 full size refrigerators was a huge bonus! We loved the open floor plan with the living room and deck. There are so many amenities and things to do at the house. There is something for everyone! We spent one of our days using the stand up paddle boards on the lake. The deck has an amazing view of the water and plenty of seating for our group of 15. It is a great spot to relax, play games, read a book, or take a nap! We were so busy with all of the outdoor activities we never even made it up to the game room! We definitely can't wait to go back!"

The house has every amenity you could imagine, especially if you have a family of chefs who love to cook together, and love to play games together. The property is majestic, right on the water, where you can enjoy sunrises and sunsets paddling in a kayak. Barb is the perfect host, she even had some treats waiting for us at checkin, so thoughtful. The Resevoir water level is low this year, so we couldn't waterski off our own dock, but the Prineville Resevoir is only 30 min away, so we had a couple great day trips, complete with a stop at Dairy Queen for icecream in town. An awesome retreat, we will return!"

Group trip","This is a great spot for a larger group. We have no complaints about our stay. I highly recommend this space. Here is a break down:
1. The host- very nice and prompt to respond to questions before, during, and after the booking. She was very helpful and kind, made this process easy and worry free. One of the best experiences I’ve had to date with renting a weekend spot.
2. Location- central Oregon off a main road, however traffic does not interfere with having a good time. Plenty of space to park, we had 8 vehicles.
3. House- AMAZING! Washer and dryer if needed. Kitchen is well stocked with cookware to make large meals, plenty of glasses, plates, silverware, etc. We did not have to improvise. This place easily sleeps 15 people...we did not use all the sleeping spaces. The house was clean and is maintained well. Rec room was a blast. The patio had a grill and plenty of space to sunbathe, eat lunch/dinner at picnic tables, chat next to a gas fireplace in comfy chairs, etc!
4. The Lake- this is a reservoir, so water levels will fluctuate. We were there when the water was low and the doc was exposed. Not a big deal though because the house has several kayaks, paddle boards, life vests and floatation tubes that can easily be walked into the water. We brought several of our own tubes and enjoyed the sunny days on the water. It was awesome to lay back on the doc and look at the stars and moon during the night too.
5. Outside- in the shed are lots a lawn games to play and plenty of lawn space to set up. There are areas to hang a hammock (we brought our own). There is a wood burning fire pit to enjoy. The landscaping is well done and maintained.
There is nothing bad to say about the house, location, host, or our time while here. Enjoy!"

We came for tree nights in the end of July and the water level was low so we couldn’t rent jet-ski or boat, but we were enjoyed pedal boarding and kayaking. Because this lake have zero (or so) visitors it is very nice and quiet especially for kayaking and pedal boarding which was thoughtfully included in the house.
Firepit by the house with a great view on a lake was a nice addition. Plenty of firewood were provided as well.
Overall we very much enjoyed the house and its peacefulness surroundings."

Having all of the games at the house along with water toys (kayaks, paddle boards, etc) was the perfect touch to make sure we had ample entertainment. The deck has ample seating for relaxing and catching some sun.

Group trip","This house is truly wonderful, a beautiful space on a peaceful lake with plenty of activities and room for a large group to do different things but also come together for meals or larger gatherings. Their toy shed has kayaks, life jackets, and every possible lawn game you could imagine. The large deck and garden was perfect for morning yoga, reading in the afternoons and meals all together.
The location is beautiful, we saw the sunset each night and used the fire pit where we played guitar and watched the moon rise over the lake.
The house is well equipped and recently renovated with modern appliances and a full kitchen - we cooked every meal here for over a week and found every niche tool we could need, including lemon zester, temp controlled wine fridge, and industrial blender!
The house is well situated for hikes in both the desert — the Painted Hills/Smith Rock State Park, and the mountains — Three Sisters/Green Lakes/Tumalo Falls. We also found the drive to Bend pleasant and easy.
Barb was really helpful and responsive beforehand and during the week.
I would highly recommend this gem for anyone looking for a quiet retreat, hiking/climbing trip or just a great place to hang out and relax. We’d definitely love to stay again!"

The description and pics are accurate. Rimrock setting is secluded and private, but safe and not isolated. Studio is a fine layout for a single or a couple, well stocked and is thoughtfully appointed. Good internet speed - was sufficient to stream Thursday Night Football on Prime. :) Expansive view to the east - during a three-night stay caught two beautiful sunrises. Good location to explore Central Oregon and points East. The Crooked River canyon is ruggedly beautiful with good fly-fishing. Hosts could not have been better - the quality of their guests' stay is clearly important to them. And agree with all the thumbs up for Izzy’s granola!"

Izzy and Jason when out of their way to make our visit memorable. Their HOA was throwing them curve balls on some road construction. Izzy's communication was frequent, accurate, and helpful.
As a bit of a bonus, if you are food or bicycling fans, you may have just found your preferred central Oregon home base. Izzy's granola is a breakfast revelation. Jason builds bike frames for cycling royalty. Access to amazing biking is readily accessible with beautiful views and lightly traveled roads. Prineville is a super interesting town. Access to Bend is easy. There are spectacular parks and hikes in close proximity.
We enjoyed our visit very much and look forward to returning in the future."

Stayed a few nights","The VIEW, privacy, and tranquil setting were the best! Exploring the property uphill about 100 yards to the base of the rim rock was pleasant and interesting. Inside, the steps up to the spacious studio were well worth it. The kitchen and bath had everything and there was plenty of room for two to be comfortable. The dining area table and chairs are gorgeous as is the big sleigh bed, which had a medium firm mattress we found quite comfortable. The studio is flooded with natural light from every side and two skylights— late sleepers will need to bring an eyeshade! WiFi and Verizon cell worked fine despite distance from town . Didn’t use the wood stove or TV. The space was warm but AC “split” unit cooled it effectively. Hosts were nearby in separate home but gave us our privacy."

Nice views of the valley and short pleasant strolling along the basalt cliffs on the property really helped get our bearings. We are from Montana and are planning on moving to the area in a few months for my husbands work. This place was a great introduction and jumping off point to explore some other areas. Izzys Granola was also super tasty. Thanks again for an awesome stay!"

There is a beautiful view, it is very peaceful and quiet, comfortable, and in a great location close to Smith Rock (20 minutes) and restaurants in Prineville. It's the kind of place you could enjoy just sitting there and looking out the window, letting all the stress of life slip away. However, there is plenty to do nearby, so I think it would be a good place for folks of any activity level to enjoy."

Stayed a few nights","This spacious, comfortable, one-room studio is a great place to stay in the Prineville area. It’s a quiet and scenic space a few miles outside of town that sits just under the gorgeous and scenic rim rock that is so unique to the area.
We didn’t use the kitchen but it looked well stocked with just about anything you’d need. We didn’t use the tv either. It’s small compared to today’s mega tvs but we didn’t need it, so it didn’t matter.
If you like a large, firm bed, you’ll live this bed.
We watched the sunrise each morning through the east-facing window and enjoyed the small balcony that gave us the greatest view of the valley.
Our hosts, who occupy the main house that sits on the hill just above the studio, happened to be away during our visit, but they stayed in touch during the time we were there through Airbnb’s messaging app.
If you want a quiet and comfortable getaway outside of the city proper, and you enjoy great views, this place is the one to book."

Stayed a few nights","From the several airbnb experiences we’ve had over the years, none came closer to staying at Isabelle and Jason’s place. They go above and beyond to ensure you have a perfect experience. Communication, cleanliness, amenities - it just doesn’t get better than this!
We’ve stayed twice and I’m sure we’ll return. If you’re looking for a place to stay in the Bend region, it’s pointless to search any further!"

They were easy to talk to and gave out great info on local sites. The guest suite is a private getaway while being able to enjoy the incredible landscapes through the windows and on the balcony. Their place is only about 20 minutes to Smith Rock, and within a couple minutes to some great restaurants in Prineville. And the sample of Busy Izzy’s power granola was an unexpected gift, which definitely hooked my wife and I on their granola! Definitely stay here if you have the chance!!"

The rental is comfortable, spacious, and clean, with many thoughtful touches like high quality linens and toiletries, that make for a really nice stay. The bed was especially comfortable, with an incredible view. Isabelle is a wonderful host. We appreciated her checking in with us after the first night to make sure everything was going well.

The hosts were very welcoming as well, Isabelle makes delicious granola and Jason even noticed a problem with my car that may have led to some serious issues on our drive back had he not pointed it out. It is a bit outside of town, but I think that adds to the allure of the studio. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","This is a lovely, bright apartment with an open-concept living. Two long rectangular skylights provide additional light. There is an outstanding view of the Ochoco Valley from the slider/tiny deck and large living room window. The sunrises are fantastic. Ventilation is provided through the open slider and a tall narrow window on the far side of the room. Our days during our stay in July were sunny with high temps in the 85-90 range. By morning the air was a crisp 58°. We utilized the large stand-up fan. There are 20 steps in the stairway from the entry door up to the living quarters. An ample assortment of dishes and cookware are provided as well as basics to help the cook: oil, salt, pepper, a few spices, sugar, plastic wrap, and foil. The tap water tastes excellent, and we are particular about that! The bed is comfortably firm. The bathroom is large with a variety of soaps/shampoo/lotion. Isabelle and Jason are delightful and accommodating. We look forward to our next visit."

But if you want privacy, gorgeous views, an excellent bed, and a place to build a cozy fire and sit down at a table to eat a meal, this is the rental for you!

Stayed a few nights","While searching for a place to escape from the city for a long weekend near Smith Rock and Bend, we were extremely lucky to find Isabelle and Jason's place! Quiet, impeccably clean, comfortable, and equipped with way more than anyone could reasonably need.
If you're looking for a place to reconnect with nature, search no more. The breathtaking Smith Rock State Park, great for rock-climbing, hiking and sightseeing, is just a short drive away. The fabulous views from the balcony are perfect to slow down and rest from an action-packed day - or simply to read a book and have a glass of wine while birds chirp around you.
Isabelle and Jason are super hosts indeed! Extremely kind and friendly, they made us feel as if we were at home. Communication was perfect from the moment we booked until the moment we checked out. We can't wait to come back!"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay exceeded our expectations, we loved every minute of our cozy, secluded getaway and hope to return again.
As a host, Isabelle was communicative and responsive from the start. She was super flexible in our arrival and departure times, which we really appreciated due to some unforeseen changes in our itinerary. Isabelle stopped in to check on us shortly after our arrival to make sure we were settling in OK and besides that we felt like we had the whole spot to ourselves.
Although the guesthouse shares the stunning property with the main house, it is set below on hill, with sweeping views of the whole valley and we found it sufficiently private for a romantic getaway.
The photos provided show all the amenities but we were pleasantly surprised upon our arrival with the quality of the furnishing and attention to detail. The guest house really offers the best of modern comfort with a cozy, rustic aesthetic fitting to the region. We loved the open layout and the easy-to-use wood stove that was perfectly stocked with fire fixings (there is central heating as well).
The kitchen was obviously stocked by a cook, which was perfect, as we made the most of the rental by enjoying our meals in. A candlelit dinner followed by reading in front of the fire on the cozy leather love seat and then watching our favorite show on the big screen TV from the dreamiest bed. (We loved that Isabelle brought us over an HDMI cable to watch shows from our own computer/accounts.)
OH! And did I mention the hot tub. Nestled among these impressive rocks with a tasteful wooden fence for privacy and a sweeping view.
From the attentive host, to the natural beauty of the place, to the cozy space and quality details ... a 5-Star stay perfect for a cozy but luxurious getaway."

This was the perfect location to rest after hiking in the surrounding area, including Smith Rock, and sooth the muscles with a dip in the hot tub with a wonderful clear view of the stars. Great way to get out of the urban area, enjoy the outdoors, while still remaining close to the Bend area. We will keep their guest home on our go-to Airbnb list for future getaways!"

Stayed one night","The space was as described a walk-in downstairs that was comfortably furnished. This is not high end ritz, but down home comfortable and the pictures depict it well. They did a nice job of creating a cozy spot. My wife immediately found and enjoyed the reclining heated massage chair.
We got in near sundown and came upon the gate while the owner was outside and he opened up for us and we had a nice conversation. He generously provided us fresh eggs for our breakfast as they had extra on hand. Much appreciated.
Allegra was very accommodating and quick to respond as we originally booked for two people, but added another couple with their dog to our group as they came to visit on short notice.
This was an excellent choice to start our Painted Hiils/stargazing journey.
Thank you Allegra!"

Stayed a few nights","Second time at Wine Down Ranch and it’s as lovely as I remember. For both a romantic getaway and a family reunion, we found peace and quality time easy to come by. I love being greeted by the two eager herding dogs, who serve as the ranch’s unofficial welcoming committee, and the hosts are out and about (I came both times during a busy farm season) for questions, recommendations and chats about ranch living. Don’t - I repeat, DON’T - miss out on grilling some of their ranch-raised beef (if that’s in your diet) for a quiet night in. I recommend bringing a bottle of red wine & seeing if the neighboring cheese-maker has cheese available for purchase to add compliment your meal."

Stayed a few nights","READ BEFORE YOU BOOK! The reason I chose this cabin is because the location was close to my sisters house. It was nice to have our own space. Also, she had good ratings which was shocking to me, as the cabin has safety issues and run down. But the $100 a night for up to 5 people is a good price. I told her ahead of time that we have 3 kids and even gave ages. My son never made it. Later she complained about 3 beds out of the 4 being used. Also, she accused us in having 5 guests, because the kitchen chairs were moved. They were moved to keep the broken bedroom door closed. Suggestions for guests: 1. Don't bring your service dog. She will find hair on the comforter, and charge you $65. 2. Bring your own comforter. Apparently, she only washes them when she gets the additional cleaning fee. 3. Ask ahead of time where the electrical panel is, as the electricity goes out frequently and you have to go outside to flip the switch. 4. Be prepared to be asked to put your dog on a leash, while her dogs run free. 5. There is a rental house right next door. And their personal house across the driveway. Not much privacy. 6. No spices, aluminum foil, siran wrap, sandwhich bags, or muffin pans. 7. Finally, have an in person pre-walk through and a post-walk through. Suggestions for Host: 1. Have a licenced Electrician look at the electricity. 2. Clean the 1/4"" thick dust of the celing fan. 3. Repair the large celing hole properly. A big piece of wood is hanging off the sheet rock ceiling with insulation coming out. 4. Replace the refrigerator. The shelves fall out and the duct tape fix is not working. 5. Remove the clutter. (Saddle on the ground, hat on the hook, 2 pairs of cowboy boots on the floor.). 6. The indoor recycled containers are nice, but seeing other peoples cans and bottles surprised us. 7. Fix the broken bedroom door. It doesnt close. 8. Put a fence up so guests can enjoy the front porce, without being barked at non stop by your dogs. 9. Finally, treat ALL your guests kindly. We cleaned, vaccumed, mopped, and even took the garbage to my sisters house. We over- communicated to you before we showed up. We paid $45 for my moms travel trailer to have electricity, but she had to use her solar panels instead. We sensed we were not welcome when we met Roy. We never met Mary but her emails were less than friendly. We deserved better treatment."

Although we didn't have cell service, can't say we missed it. Part of the reason this place is great. If you are looking for a spot to use as a home base to explore this area, would definitely suggest staying here. PS - nice hot water and good water pressure in the shower.

What is really outstanding is the landscape around ranch itself. Just a walk through the pasture with our dog was very memorable. We also hiked up to the mesa- a steep hike but the views were worth it. Would love to come back in the summer!"

The dogs were sweet and played well with our 9 year old girl and our dog. The land itself is beautiful, and could have spent months exploring the property’s many trails. Absolute Perfection!"

Stayed about a week","My husband, 9 month old puppy, and I spent a week at Wine Down Ranch this October, staying in the bunkhouse. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The ranch is located in a lovely and very peaceful valley and it is enormous and abuts the National Forest so you can take long walks/ hikes in the pastures, hills, woodlands etc... without having to drive anywhere. There are also a lot of great sites to see in the vicinity such as The Painted Hills (part of the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument), Smith Rock State Park, the other 2 units of John Day (Sheep Rock and Clarno), and lots of other scenic hiking spots. The bunkhouse is very cozy and well-equipped for cooking, sleeping, and relaxing. Mary kept us stocked with plenty of wood for the woodstove as the evenings were pretty chilly. The ranch property itself is very picturesque with sage, chamisa, junipers, ponderosa pines, and pastureland. The horses run right behind the bunkhouse a few times a day which got our puppy very excited. This vacation was everything that I had hoped for and more! I cannot recommend a stay at Wine Down Ranch highly enough!"

Lots of hiking on the ranch itself and it borders the Ochoco National Forest so it is a quick drive up the road to access the forest service roads. We got to see lots of wildlife. We loved sitting out on the deck under the stars and listening to the coyotes howl. The Painted Hills National Monument is only a 40 min drive from the ranch.

Stayed a few nights","The bunkhouse is so cute & is well equipped. The bed & pillows are very comfortable. It was perfect for us. My husband wants to buy a pillow just like the one he slept on! It's a wonderful place with incredibly beautiful surroundings. I loved the horses running & walking by the bedroom window. So beautiful & fun. I was nervous about the dog(s) bc my husband doesnt like dogs, but one of the three dogs was so cute & fun, shockingly he had my husband playing with him! I think it was the orange collared dog. He acted like the bunk house guests dog & followed us all over wanting to play. Cracked us up.
The description of the cabin (bunkhouse) online makes it appears the cabin is private & secluded, but when we drove in I was surprised how close to the main house it was (houses - looks like they built a new house across from the bunk house). I suggested a privacy fence between the cabin & house(s) would be a great improvement. It's a working ranch & equipment and supplies are a bit cluttered & messy looking around the place. The map of trails on the property in the bunkhouse book was difficult to understand. Probably makes sense if you know the starting point, but we couldn't figure it out & just walked around aimlessly. We could have emailed or waved Mary down for directions, but didn't want to bother her. We visited the Stein Pillar, which was spectacular. Didn't make it to the palisades or swimming hole due to the rain. Maybe next time. Overall, we had a very relaxing and wonderful time & would recommend if you want to wine down & relax."

I had brought some apples and carrots for the horses and they loved them. The song birds were a joy. Farm is away from city lights so enjoying the stars at night was special. The walks or hikes in the meadows and through the trees were lovely. The ranch is in a good location for visits to Smith Rocks and the Painted Hills. If you want a break from the Internet and your cell phone this is the place to go and recoup."

The house was clean and had everything we needed. there was also fresh meat from the ranch and cheese from a local farm available to us. Next time we'd love to take advantage of the barbecue on the deck for a farm to table dinner. Visiting with the horses was also very therapeutic especially after recent pandemic stressors in the last year. The whole getaway was a revitalizing breath of fresh (country) air.

Stayed with kids","This is an amazing location if you need to stay in the area but don’t want to stay in town at a traditional home/residential area. We loved the ranch and what it offers. Mary, her husband and their doggies were amazing. Very sweet caring people.
The queen bed was super comfy and there is four other twin sized beds in the other room. Would four adults want to stay in the one room? Maybe not, but it is perfect for kids. Our 3 year old loved the location. He played with their dogs and had a blast. We cooked everyday in the kitchen and the small stove was fine for our size of family (3 of us). There is no TV or WiFi. We were able to get Verizon service with enough LTE internet to get streaming video for movies in the evening. Overall a great stay.
We will definitely book again."

The ranch dogs were very friendly and willingly accompanied us on our hikes around the property. The free roaming horses and cattle were fun to encounter.

Stayed with kids","The Wine Down Ranch bunkhouse was the perfect getaway for our family. It was cozy, and we had no cell service or wifi, which was exactly what we were looking for. The kitchen had everything we needed to make our own meals, and we took advantage of that. We made a daily meander to the barn to feed carrots to the horses and throw rocks in the creek on the way back. Roy generously answered my questions about the farm equipment and animals. We even got to see Mary and Roy move their cattle on horseback with the help of their dogs.
We were there during some unseasonable heat (95 degrees F), so didn't go on any hikes, but Mary and Roy directed us to a nice little spot in the creek where we could cool off and our two-year-old could splash to her heart's content. We enjoyed local breweries in Prineville and Redmond in the heat of the day, and made plans to come back and see Wine Down Ranch in all of its seasons."

Stayed a few nights","The ranch was easy to find and we didn't even need the directions Mary sent us! It is convenient to town (about 15 minutes), quiet and serene. Roy welcomed us to the property and let us know we could explore anywhere there was a road, and we did! The dogs, Tex and Mickie, were about as human and dog friendly as dogs come and treated my dog like she was part of their pack. Tex and Mickie gave us the tour of the property as soon as we arrived! The bunkhouse is well stocked with things like dishes, a coffee maker, games!!! and even coffee itself. We stayed for a cold snap and helped ourselves to the wood stove, as there were directions posted on the wall. Everything was easy to access and cozy. The bunkhouse overlooks the horse pasture and mountains and has a large deck and even a grill. We did not full on cook, but could have easily if we wanted to. It was an added bonus that they were ok with cigarette smoking outside as long as we packed our butts out, which we did! I will absolutely be asking to come back in the future with my horse in tow! Best first Air Bnb experience ever!"

The first day we traveled to the Painted Hills - about an hour and 15 minutes drive. The second day we traveled to John Day Fossil Sheep Rock area - about 1 hour and 47 minutes drive. The third day we spent time at the ranch and hiked the hills on the land there. Our kids enjoyed playing fetch with the dogs, feeding the horses apples and carrots, and learning a little bit about life on a ranch. They played the Battleship game in the box of games every day. We read stories from the books on the shelf. We really enjoyed warming up by the wood fire and were provided plenty of wood for our stay. The Bunkhouse and Wine Down Ranch feels like a very special place next to the Ochoco National Forest. We are thankful to have stayed there. The hosts do a great job of adding a personal touch."

The bunk house has everything you should need for a weekend getaway and was cozy with the wood burning fireplace. The property itself is truly worth the stay with plenty of room to explore and wonderful trails to hike.

The location is great. We hiked the Stein's Pillar trail and the Chimney Rock Trail along Crooked River.

Great view from the windows of horses, fields and just the country feel.
I had cell service with Verizon, but the idea is to get away from it all. Enjoy the fire, some popcorn, wine, puzzles and travel planning documents of the area. They even have their own hiking trails to enjoy on site. It has a cool camp stove for cooking in the kitchen. Adds to the feel of being in a bunk house on a ranch.
Lots of things to do nearby, plus on the property. We drove the forest roads out to Steins pillar and enjoyed a hike to stretch the legs. Then headed out to the painted hills for sunset. On the drive home up through The Dalles, we detoured a bit outside madras to hit the coves palisades park. Amazing views. Be sure to hit the upper viewpoint if you go. Then there is the interesting ghost town of Shaniko to check out.

Stayed a few nights","Had a great stay at the bunk house at Wine Down Ranch! Mary and Roy were incredibly hospitable and helpful, and the ranch itself was really cool to see the horses and cows about, all the wide open spaces, hang out with the sweet and social ranch dogs, and have a cozy fire going while the sunset blazes over the hills beside you. Great jumping off point to visit the painted hills. Nice touches as the bunk house itself like games to play, coffee, chocolate, and popcorn at the ready, and firewood provided for both the fire pit outside and the fireplace inside (Mary was also sweet to check in and ask if we needed more firewood, which she dropped off for us). A great blend of adventure and relaxation for our weekend, we would definitely come back."

Nice ranch dogs and horses and they have a bbq grill. I bought a fresh cut NY steak from them from their Angus herd and it was fantastic. Super nice people...great setting and views and the perfect front deck for a post ride IPA to watch the sunset. I will definitely come back:) Oh and a woodstove too and they supply the wood.

Stayed a few nights","Tired of the constant bombardment of social media, news, and the blah blah? Make your way to Mary and Roy's bunkhouse or small home. 2100 hundred acres of working ranch land bordering a National forest. From the moment you hear the crunch of gravel under your tires, you realize you have moved back to a simpler time.
The bunkhouse sets back on the hillside with a full deck in front. Entering you see a clean well-stocked kitchen with everything you need to cook with. The bath is clean and set up very functionally. I loved the quaint bunkroom and wish we could have brought our kids here when they were young. The living and bedroom were spacious and full of light. The bed was very comfortable.
We bought a steak from the ranch, it was out of this world. My husband still talks about it. Thanks, Mary! We will be back to unplug, unwind, and enjoy the peace and quiet. Our stay was everything we expected and more. If you really want to get away this is the place. Great hosts, wonderful accommodations, and authentic ranch life. This is the place for peace."

Stayed a few nights","I can’t possibly list all the amazing things about Mary and Roy’s ranch. I’m a mom of two very little boys and needed a solo escape to roam free on my own. I am SO glad that I was able to stay here! It’s an outdoor wonderland, truly. They literally have a trail map for their property with some trails for every level (highly recommend the Little Table trail to the top if you want to get some real exercise and see some amazing 360 views!). They offer beef and eggs right from their ranch, and veggies from their garden. I got it all :) I decided to leave my dog at home this trip but had a blast hanging with their awesome ranch dogs, and with their horses, at least two of which are basically giant dogs - so friendly! (Pro tip: bring extra apples and carrots.) I got to ride my mountain bike, hike my tail off, watch sunsets and sunrises and shooting stars (so many stars!!), shoot my bow, and explore endlessly without ever having to get in my car. PARADISE! And Mary and the family are so incredibly cool that I asked to stay an extra day. Can’t wait to see it in all four seasons! Moms take note: This was an absolutely exceptional solo experience! I do plan on bringing my family with me next time (your kids and dogs will love this place!), but I’ll definitely be back for another solo mom escape or three :) 10 out of 10 from me!!"

Stayed a few nights","The location is beautiful, relaxing, calm, and quiet and for that, it would get five stars. The accommodations themselves I would give three stars. And the host would have to get one star. The accommodations would get three because there were OK. The stove is a camp stove . The kitchen is stocked with some dishes but I am not sure there are enough to feed five (the number of beds there). There are no spices or mugs which was surprising given the distance from town which essentially forces you to cook at the residence. The clean towels were wet in the drawer. All of which was not great but OK. But it was the host that really got to me. She was clearly upset that we brought my service dog, even though it clearly states that the residence is ""dog friendly"". I admit that it would been polite if I had let her know in advance but honestly, I didn't think of it. Due to her entirely frigid and unwelcoming response upon our arrival, I did not feel comfortable calling upon her to assist in accessing all of the amenities described (horseback riding, trail running, feeding the horses. She has dogs and the second day, her ""less friendly"" dog sat outside barking non-stop at us as we tried to eat breakfast on the porch - she drove past us in her car but didn't try to stop her dog. And, while most hosts check in somehow during a longer stay just to see how things are going, we never heard from her apart from our initial unpleasant meeting. We were on a one week vacation. Happily, but also sadly, meeting her was the worst part of an otherwise great trip. While it was beautiful, I would not stay there again."

The three ranch dogs kept us company when we were outside and taking walks--bonus star for them! Beautiful location--hard to beat."

Their property is gorgeous and is the perfect place for those looking to get away and wine-down. We had the best time wandering the property playing with the dogs, petting the horses, and taking in the incredible views. Their property offers plenty of places to run, hike, and explore. This was our first visit to Prineville, and we did not want to leave!
The bunkhouse has everything you need to cook for yourself while at the Ranch. We were very impressed by the CampChef oven and stovetop. The wood-burning stove kept us super cozy at night. The bunk house has so many authentic ranch-style touches, like the lasso and the horseshoe hooks on the walls. Mornings were so peaceful, coffee on the porch just watching the animals. But the real view is when the stars come out at night! Its worth bundling up and going for a walk.

Would highly recommend you book this stay!!"

Our pup got along great with the three dogs on the ranch, and morning walks along the creek with all of them was a great start to our days. The wood burning stove inside was a great way to warm up after hiking around the property. The camp stove was pretty easy to cook with, but be aware you’ll just have the two burners and small oven to cook with (and a barbecue outside). Roy and Mary were fantastic hosts, friendly and accommodating. The cabin is also in a great location for numerous day trips in the area."

Our boys and us loved playing with the dogs, and they chaperoned us across our treks... even sledding on the back hill. The horses are so gentle and friendly. The cows... well, they weren't exactly sociable, but they were calving, so protective. The bunkhouse is old and basic, but cozy, well insulated, not drafty and not lacking anything... the water was hot and plentiful, there's a full shower, a full sized refrigerator, the camp stove was easy to cook on. The wood burning stove was easy to use and kept the place cozy (easily dampened down for low heat throughout the night). Mary and Roy were super nice. I can see why they call their ranch the Wine Down Ranch... it's the perfect place to come, disconnect, roam around the countryside, grill up a meal, and open a good wine. The one stand out surprise during our stay was that early in the wee morning hours one day we heard a weird rumble that woke us up... we peaked out the back window to see some huge shadowy figures in the faint morning light moving right behind the bunkhouse! It was the horses... they have access right behind the bunkhouse to a back pasture. It was a little freaky for a moment for us city folk... but very cool."

The cell reception is spotty (we have AT&T) but we preferred it that way. We brought our pup with us and he enjoyed playing with the dogs. As did my two boys. The dogs are very well trained and are great guides for hikes. The country surrounding in beautiful and makes for great hiking! Not too far from town. It really is an amazing getaway spot.

We loved that the dogs loved us! The rustic space at the bunkhouse was such a fun break from the ""same ole', same ole'!"" The space is very ""cowboy"" and it is cute and clean too. The host was very available and attentive to our needs. We definitely hope to stay there again soon!"

Stayed a few nights",Rustic bunkhouse in the country. Great place to get away from it all - but yet close to top attractions Smith Rock and Painted Hills. There is a Whole Foods in Bend about an hour away. The dogs are super friendly and love to play pine comb and go for walks. If you have Verizon it does work at the bunkhouse. Check in was a breeze and great communication. A great place to unwind - no Wi Fi (but off your phone - perhaps) and no TV. Plenty of trails on the property - some go into the Ochoco National Forest.

The house is equipped with anything you may need. Drinking water in the fridge and running fans before we arrived were appreciated. We hiked the ranch trails with the dogs and loved the experience!

There were also unexpected delights, and these made staying at the Bunkhouse even more enchanting. We enjoyed talking with our hosts, and learning about things that city dwellers don't often get to learn about firsthand. It seems like the Wine Down Ranch would be a great place to bring younger children - so many great things to experience."

came out for the northern lights and stargazing and the home is just far enough outside city limits where you have peace and quiet but close enough where you can go into town for anything you might need.
also, i seriously had some of the best sleep ever. the bed in there is comfy af 🤣🤌
the home is incredibly cozy and comfortable. jacuzzi outside and beautiful area. would absolutely stay again. 😁

Hot tub was wonderful and almost entirely private. Only complaint was that it wasn't close enough to our destination of the Painted Hills, but that was on us. Would recommend!"

Stayed over a week","I’ve been doing Air Bnb for a while and have stayed in many great places, but Tera’s house was the epitome of what Air Bnb is all about: feeling like a local and being welcomed by a friendly host.
I stayed for about a month, on work detail, and this space was what I needed, especially being far away from home. When I arrived, Tera was responsive, made of list of how to take care of the space (we were in a deep freeze), and stocked the place with fresh linens, soap and basic toiletries, and yummy treats like chocolate, red vine, and pop corn! What a wonderful welcome!
I relished coming home everyday to this peaceful space, which overlooked a farm field and the buttes toward Juniper canyon. The flock of quail that come and go are hilarious butterballs!
Also I didn’t realize this place had a hot tub! It’s in great condition, super clean and cozy. I suggest a soak on a clear, cold night with all the lights off so you can look at the stars.
I also gained friends too: Tera and Derrick 🫶"

She had wonderful suggestions for places to explore nearby (the farmers market was really enjoyable), and we enjoyed a short bike ride on the nearby Scenic Bikeway with lovely scenic vistas (she generously allowed us to put our bikes in her garage). We came and went with ease. One of us being a light sleeper, the Friday evening road noise was noticeable (window was open for ventilation), but we still managed to rest well. The back patio was magical in the evening. A great value and very welcoming, comfy place for our two nights in Prineville!"

I was expecting Prineville to be a small town where we would bed for the night and that's it. I couldn't have been more wrong. The town was so fun with a thriving and friendly food scene that we learned about from Barbara's helpful recommendations list. It was a very cozy and homey stay. Couldn't have asked for more and will definitely be visiting again.

Stayed a few nights","Barbara is a friendly host and she made our stay very comfortable. The room is very clean and stylish. The bathroom is clean as well. This neighborhood is quiet and we enjoyed watching the birds every morning in the backyard. They come to visit Barbara everyday. Overall, if you're plan to visit John Day Fossil Beds National Monument (Painted Hills), this is gonna be a top place to stay for you in the area!"

Stayed one night","Barbara is a wonderful host. She greeted me on arrival and showed me around. The room and the private bath are located upstairs. There is coffee/Tea in the room. This BnB is the most spotless unit in my experience. There is parking in the housing complex, my car was safe. There is no TV, but there is WiFi. I streamed my channels on my IPad. The bed was comfortable, there is a desk and chair, another upholstered chair. She has a second room that Barbara will allow you to use if if you have three in your party."
