Stayed a few nights","Toms place was an alternative to staying at a hotel while I was in the area for business. Easily the best decision we made to stay here, house was cleanly and comfortable. Outside patio area on the canal offered a much needed relaxation area at the end of the day. Didn’t have much time to fish so wasn’t able to reel in anything, but trying again next time! Thanks Tom"

Group trip","Redneck Riviera did exactly what we wanted it to do. It was a place to sleep, eat and shower. The place was fine. We went in January to fish. I have no idea what to do in the area but the fishing was decent. Tom’s place was great for fishermen to stay in during the season. 6 minutes to the Kissimmee river launch."

Side note: we left our house keys by accident, and he allowed my family to go get them, so they could over night them. He was fast, and responsive, and willing to help. So thankful for that!"

Close driving distance to great restaurants (really liked Pueblo Viejo) and takeout (Okeechobee Fish Co), as well as fishing guides, airboat ries, etc. Although we could have easily never left the great backyard. Host was super communicative. We would stay here again in the blink of an eye. Highly recommended."

Stayed with kids","This is our second time booking the Redneck Riviera, definitely not our last! Our family it’s so very happy, we never want to leave. We are planing our third stay for next year! It feels like home away from home. I will share a list of the top ten things we absolutely love about the Redneck Riviera:
1. Fishing 🎣 large mouth bass, cat fish, sun fish, sicklets…
2. Location, close to Lake Okeechobee.
3. Nature, clear skies, lots of greens, pure air, birds, gators, turtles…Stars gazing, beautiful sky!
4. Ambiance, very very peaceful!
5. Amenities, pool, hot tub!
6. House is well equipped with appliances, air fryer, pots, washer/dryer and stocked with everything you need to cook.
7. Comfortable beds, all of them!
8. Lots of seating arrangements inside and outside.
9. Great neighbors! Quite, private and friendly.
10. Last but not lest, the host…amazing Tom! He is absolutely the best. He stays in contact throughout the stay and always on top of everything. So happy got to meet him in our last stay. Thank you Tom 🙏"

Stayed a few nights","The place is fantastic, exactly what it said it would be, affordable. The place was very quaint and quite, just far enough away to have our little slice of peace, but close enough to still have civilization. It was very very clean, the backyard patio were perfect. It’s South Florida so there are gators and mosquitoes that are nearly prehistoric. Both are huge and both will try to drag you off given the chance. I can’t thank Tom and Debbie enough for providing us with such a perfect place to stay for a few days. They had everything to fish the canal there, they had bug spray ready to go, the pool was clean and the hot tub was hot.
This isn’t the Ritz Carlton, it’s better. Trust me if you’re in the area, this is the place to stay!"

Tom and Debbie are amazing hosts, great communication, friendfly and helpful. We were enchanted the minute we entered the driveway. This home has everything, located in Buckhead Ridge, waterfront right on the Okeechobee Lake, pool, hot tub, fishing gear, fish food, with beautiful and peaceful views. The house has so many special touches and details, inside and outside! We felt transported to another world. We created beautiful memories with our children. This stay, in general, surpassed our expectations and all I can say is that...cant wait to be back again and again."

Stayed with kids","Our stay at the Redneck Riviera was amazing! After driving 20+ hours from Oklahoma, walking into a nice cool clean house was refreshing! The house was very clean, the beds were comfortable and there was plenty of space inside and out for our family of six. The front yard is beautiful with a wide array of plants and trees, the backyard and patio were perfect for a family get together with the pool to swim and the canal to fish! There are frogs and lizards aplenty and the occasional (small) gator in the canal. If you plan on being outside at night just make sure you wear mosquito repellent. We enjoyed the quiet location and would definitely recommend Toms place to anyone!"

Group trip","The Redneck Rivera was a great place for a week of red necks to hang out. We enjoyed fishing in the canal, sitting by the pool, and dipping in the hot tub. At dusk the mosquitos are unavoidable, but that’s FL. During the daytime to pool is perfect to cool off. We planned a hog hunt while here with Lightsey Family ranch, and took 2 fishing trips with Okeechobee fishing headquarters (Bass) and Small waters outfitters (crappie) we also made the drive to Everglades holiday park for the day for Peacock Bass fishing, gators, and airboat rides. We had everything we needed to Cook our keepers!! We haven’t even checked out yet and my kids are planning their return trip!! We will be back!"

Tom makes it a priority to see that you are on track to get the most out of your stay. The 'cabana' outside was so great, dipping in the hot tub, cooling off in the pool, and cooking out on the grill, all were highlights with plenty of room to gather for a meal outside right on the canal. We recommend 'The Redneck Riviera' highly to anyone seeking a delightful stay on Lake Okeechobee."

Sitting on the back porch, watching birds and the canal was so relaxing.

Stayed with kids","The home is spacious and comfortable but there are a few things not mentioned in the listing. First, the owner occupies a portion of the home during your stay. It was not a problem for us but, keep in mind that they have full access if you leave it unoccupied.
The jetted tub in the master bathroom doesn’t work and both bathroom showers were quite dirty. The rest of the house was okay but cobwebs and dust bunnies tell me it needs a bit more attention. The refrigerator and pantry is full of food supplies (assuming for the owner) so if you’re staying a while you won’t have much space for supplies in the kitchen. The outdoor space is nice and the one of the cows are friendly ( we saw no other wildlife )
WiFi is pretty good and you can get delivery from Publix (didn’t try any other places)."

They even had kcups, decaf and regular coffee. We felt super safe and a great location close to OK Corral. You cannot beat the price of this house. Bring groceries and cook or grill out. Patio out back is screened and has a grill to use. There is a larger outdoor area for entertaining with a pizza cooker. Great great great place. Rent with confidence.

The pictures, although impressive, don't quite capture the true beauty and comfort of the house. From the moment we walked in, we felt an immediate sense of warmth and homeliness. The attention to detail and thoughtful touches throughout the space truly made our stay memorable.
Joseph's hospitality added an extra layer of enjoyment to our trip. He was accommodating, responsive, and went above and beyond to ensure we had everything we needed. The seamless check-in process and the detailed information provided made us feel well taken care of.
We appreciate the opportunity to have stayed at Joseph's place, and we're grateful for the wonderful experience. If you're considering booking this Airbnb, don't hesitate – you'll find a host who not only takes pride in their property but also cares about creating a welcoming and enjoyable atmosphere for their guests. Thank you again, Joseph!!"

The place itself is roomy and comfortable and Joseph is very friendly and was in great communication throughout. Thank you again for the hospitality. We would stay here again in a heartbeat."

Stayed a few nights","Great stay. Very clean. Great space. Great communication. We had an issue that required someone on site and that person showed up within minutes and even followed up on the next day. Has some elements that indicate the structure is a little dated, such as subfloor feeling a bit ""soft"" under the vinyl flooring material in a couple of places. We didn't find it to be a big deal. AC was primarily 2 mini-splits and a window unit. Very effective at keeping things comfortable. The covered outdoor area was spacious and great for relaxing with protection from the bugs. There is a boat ramp on the property, but I wouldn't recommend chancing it. There is a huge marina only minutes up the street, and it gives you direct access to the lake via a short run in the Kissimmee River with no locking required. BTW, the kitchen was well equipped with pretty much everything you might need."

The Lock was closed for repair, but the home boat ramp allowed us to explore the residential waterways and the rim canal. However, there is a local boat ramp a mile or 2 up the road that is free and accessible.
The only thing Michael could have done better is to make the fish bite. Overall a great stay."

So we'll kept and the small touches such as snacks or even soaps and shampoos in every bathroom make the stay even more incredible. Donna's place has become a real home away from home for my friends and I and we look forward to booking it again next year. An amazing house ran by an amazing person. Thanks again!

Better than described, the home is spacious stocked with everything you could ever need and more. Donna not only leaves her special touch with a nice welcome basket, she communicates to make sure there is nothing else you need.
The rooms are spacious, beds are very comfortable. Kitchen is amazing and had everything we needed. The kids absolutely loved it here, they caught many of fish and just had the best time of their lives making memories with their cousins. We will definitely be coming back, thank you Donna for an amazing home."

Plenty of room for the 5 of us!
The beds are fairly firm, ok if you like that. My brother and his wife prefer that, so they were very comfortable.
As with most places in Florida, ants were an issue.
Fishing was pretty good! We caught and released catfish, and a couple of other types of fish.
All in all, beautiful place, fabulous hosts, and clean surroundings!
We all enjoyed our stay!
Thank you!!"

Stayed about a week","If I could give a listing 10 stars this would be it! Donna and Steve's brand new renovation made our Florida vacation! From check in to check out, we could not ask for anything more. The accommodations were spotless and new, we loved the screened in porch/dining area, brand new kitchen and island as well as the private dock, central AC, brand new kitchen appliances, 2 stainless steel fridges, new bathrooms, etc! The list goes on and on. The secured automated gate made entrance/exiting a breeze and we felt very secure with the surroundings so much so that we did not even utilize the alarm system. Loved all the amenities from the 80 inch flat screen TV to the love seat tree swing, this place has it all! We can't wait to stay here again as these hosts are on their way to SuperHost stardom with their eager to please and warm and pleasant personalities! Definitely recommend staying here anytime in the Okeechobee area as this one stands head and shoulders above all the rest!"

Stayed about a week","I stayed at Buckhead cottage for a bass tournament. It was perfect. The house was clean, and Enrique was quite accommidating. The carport came in handy as it rainied cats and dogs the first few days i was there and made rigging baits very comfortable and dry. The launch point for the tournament was three minutes away, so i got alot of sleep.
Although it wasnt for lack of trying i did not make high score on the gallactica full sized arcade game in the.living room.
I had a wonderful stay and will be booking again next time.
Thanks Enrique!!!"

Stayed with kids",Enridques place was nice and had that being right at home feeling to it. We liked the screened in out side portch at night to watch the football games during the day and night. We were able to cook out side under the shade nice and quiet and beautiful. Had parking up under the roof so parking was plentiful. Very nice place and a good price to stay there. Will recommend to others. Just didn’t get to use the golf cart which it says in the description golf cart was available. Then I was told the next day golf cart was for private use that it wasn’t available. But that wasn’t that big of a deal. We enjoyed ourselves and enjoyed the stay and will be back. Thanks again Enrique.

Stayed a few nights","**Review Title:** Quiet and Well-Equipped House in a Convenient Location
**Review:**
I recently stayed at this AirBnB in Florida, and it was a wonderful experience. The house is situated in a quiet neighborhood, which made for a very peaceful stay. It was clean and well-maintained, meeting all of our expectations.
The location was perfect for us. It was off the beaten path, it was still conveniently close to many places we wanted to visit. This balance of tranquility and accessibility was a huge plus.
The house itself was very well equipped. The kitchen and bathroom were well-stocked, and we had access to Wi-Fi, which was reliable throughout our stay. The amenities provided everything we needed for a comfortable stay.
Our only suggestion for improvement would be the addition of an ice cream scoop in the kitchen. However, this did not detract from our overall positive experience.
We didn't have to communicate with the host during our stay, but everything"

Stayed with kids","my family and I planned a 3 day fishing @ lake okeechobee and began looking for places to stay that pit us in close proximity to the lake, as we wanted to be on the lake early in an attempt to beat the heat. when we began looking I realized that it was going to be a challenge to a place to house all 11 in my group.
I decided to check airbnb and the 1st listing was Nathaniel's place, and it couldn't have been more perfect. it was right on the canal that fed into the lake, had enough for us to dock our 2 boats and outlets on the dock where we could charge our boats over night. also some pretty amazing fishing right off the dock.
the home itself was everything and more 55+ inch tvs in all rooms, extremely comfortable bedding options for my crew of 11, had a game room with pool table, ping pong, corn hole and more.
to say that this place had everything would be a complete understatement
there was never a dull moment for anyone from the kids all the way up through the adults"

Cozy inside, and relaxing outside being able to soak up sun in the multiple seating areas, and watch turtles, birds, and other wildlife. I was there about a month, so it certainly felt like it was my new home, and I am going to miss it. Easy check-in, and no issues.
I was on a mission to explore as much of FL as my schedule allowed, so I also really liked how I could bounce out to an Atlantic coast beach in 1 hour, and Miami, Tampa, Orlando, gulf coast side all in about 2-2.5. Okeechobee also surprised me a little. I will definitely miss the protein shakes and bowls at Lake O Nutrition so if you get the chance, give them a try!"

Stayed a few nights","Selfishly l want to say it was horrible to keep this gem hidden for myself, but my conscience won’t allow that! Chadell’s place was wonderful! Loved the decor! It was very roomy and extremely clean and neat! We reserved this place because of its close proximity to the LOST bike path along Lake Okeechobee. It was so nice to come back to such a pleasant place at the end of the day. We only stayed two nights. The last night we walked across the street and ate at “Good Spirits”. It was amazing! The restaurant is in a giant Tiki hut with a huge variety of tropical birds! A few people that reviewed this place were concerned about the area. Hey, it’s Lake Okeechobee- l love this area because it has not been spoiled by the glam and glitter of urban growth! Just because someone lives in a mobile home does not mean they are “shady” as one reviewer described. We have stayed in a variety of places when we visit this area, but l will definitely be reserving Chadell’s place for future stays."

Stayed with a pet","The apartment was just as pictured. Beautiful , spacious and clean. It is half the upstairs of a vacant industrial building on a main road. Location is good and if you just want a place to sleep while you are fishing it is fine for that.
Wifi was great, the canal view was beautiful and peaceful . Chairs on the the porch were a nice touch to sit outside.
The only reason i am not giving 5 stars for everything is because the main road the unit is on seemed to have a lot of trucks and the bar across the street was loud at times. ( maybe its just loud if you are old like me )
Emphasizing the inside is exactly as pictured and very clean .
The price was very reasonable so we'd stay here again knowing what to expect ."

Everything we needed, 2 bathrooms was nice. Quiet neighbors. Great reception and WiFi. Close to shops and restaurants. It is above a commercial storefront that they are trying to rent, so not much to look at from the street, on a busy highway. Once inside, nice place that is newly furnished and updated."

Stayed a few nights","This is a newly renovated apartment in what appears to be an old, abandoned commercial building. The inside of the apartment was very neat and clean. Most of the items in the apartment appeared to be new and it was very comfortable. I had no issues with that. The issue I had was outside the apartment. I did not realize it was a second floor apartment. The stairs leading to the second floor were not in the best condition. The area in front of the apartment next to this one had a significant amount of junk in front of it. The bar across the street has a sign that flashes all night long. So for these reasons, it was not the best fit for me."

Stayed a few nights","I feel so fortunate to have found this gem while planning a trip with my oldest daughter to see my youngest daughter who lives in Okeechobee with her family so we could spend time together during their (teacher) Christmas break.
Lori was so accommodating and communicative from the start. Everything we needed was anticipated and waiting for us there, which was no surprise being the first thing I saw when I walked in was a thoughtful handwritten note she’d left for me on the table.
Because we were there to spend time with my daughter and grandchildren, we did a lot of coming and going throughout our stay, but starting each morning sitting by the water surrounded by life and peace was so good for my soul.
One evening, both daughters and I enjoyed a couple of hours of music, s’mores, laughing, and talking around a fire we made in the fire pit in the ample space that was provided to do so.
Would highly recommend Bob, Lori, and The Crappie Cabin for a peaceful time out!"

Everything about this place was super clean and comfortable with everything laid out perfectly both inside and out including a dedicated carport for your vehicle. All the way around this was just a truly warm, welcoming and peaceful experience to where you could totally tell the people hosting truly care about what they are doing in fact even before I ever arrived for my stay I was certain everything was going to be excellent just from how welcoming and SUPER responsive and thorough the host Lori was in the days leading up to my stay she was just so terrific and going forward this place will definitely serve as the standard by which all other Airbnb's will be judged so GREAT job and thanks again!!"

I would suggest that you stay here if you are looking for a beautiful place to sit and relax by the water."

The covered boat slip with lift is a real plus for protecting and keeping your boat dry and ready for early fishing. There is a fish fish cleaning station next to the boat slip and ice maker. Jeff had lots of good advise on where the fish were biting, being a fisherman himself. The location is less then 10 minutes from the lock to enter Okeechobee. Bill's tiki bar with flat screen was the best outdoor area that we have ever seen at a private rental. 2 thumbs up!"

Within 10 minutes, Mary and Jeff (the property managers) came over with a photo for the wall and one for us to keep. We also met the neighbors on the other side of the property. Very kind people!

Stayed a few nights","We stayed a few nights at Dollar Bill’s home. It is better than the pictures! The home was clean, well stocked with linens, cleaning supplies, games, and we felt right at home. The bed was comfortable, and water pressure was good. Best of all, was the tiki hut on the water. There was a breeze always, an outdoor kitchen, ice machine, seating, and a TV for shows or music. We ate our meals, and relaxed under the tiki hut. It’s like an outdoor living room. Lots of birds, turtles, ducks, and some fish. Jeff, the next door neighbor, was friendly and made sure we had all we needed. He checked on us while there, making sure we were satisfied.
We took an airboat ride on the Lake, and ate at a tiki hut in town, and went fishing. We recommend this home to anyone in the area, over a hotel room any day. We felt safe the whole time we were there. We will venture back in the future. Thank you for having this place for a wonderful vacation.

Easy access to the lock, Taylor Creek and two boat ramps if you want to hit the north sections of the lake toward Kissimmee river. The home is well maintained and well stocked with supplies you would normally run in and out to sustain fish camp or a family. You couldn’t ask for anything else. If you are just here to fish the outdoor area is second to none. Instant access to your boat on a lift, cleaning station, grill, ice machine, tv, music and a few free beers I left in the fridge out there!"

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely stellar place located on a beautiful canal. This place was clean, spacious, and incredibly well equipped for just about anything you can think of. The house features ample space to house guests, a full kitchen, two bathrooms, and most notably, one of those most amazing private outdoor bars I've ever seen. This home features a full size tiki bar outside, right on the water, and has everything you could ever need including an ice machine, fire pit, fishing dock, fish prep station, grill, tv, you name it. The home was also well stocked with all basic supplies to cook and grill such as cooking oil, aluminum foil, sheet pans, tongs, ect. which I was grateful for. The owner, Bill, was super nice and responsive, answering all my questions quickly and offering assistance from their place next door should I need it. My only discrepancy is that the Wi-Fi was a little slow, however, this could've been due to the busy weekend Okeechobee was experiencing when I stayed. Due keep that in mind though if for any reason you need to get work done online or anything of that nature while you're there. Overall though, without a doubt I'd rate the stay 5/5, it was a fantastic experience."

Group trip","Perfect stay for almost our entire bridal party for our wedding. Ample bedding with plenty of couch space and room for air mattresses as well. We were able to host even more guests for our rehearsal dinner cookout and it worked wonderfully. There's plenty of parking space. Garr was very easy to communicate with. Unfortunately, the pool was under maintenance during our visit so we did not get to enjoy it, but the backyard provided space for us and our dog to enjoy. Garr made sure we were notified about the pool situation well before our stay and offered some alternatives. In addition, he was proactive in communicating with the maintenance crew so that they were not disturbing us when we were using the poolside grill which was greatly appreciated.
There are plenty of amenities, all of which are in good condition. The interior is comfortable and truly feels like a home. We are extremely satisfied with our stay."

Group trip",We booked this place really last minute due too another Airbnb host canceling our reservation the same day we were suppose to check in. Told the host and he definitely made us feel like we were at a home away from home! Even though it was an hour away from where we needed to be I would stay here again in a heartbeat! Definitely recommend staying here 1000000%

Stayed with kids",This was by far the most pleasant Air B and B experience our family has ever had. The home was as described and the host was fabulous— all necessities were provided plus enough breakfast food for our entire stay. So thoughtful! We will book here the next time we visit Okeechobee!

Group trip","When our hotel wasn’t able to accommodate our reservations due to a fire, Garr was able to help us out last minute. I needed a place large enough for myself and staff and this worked out so much better than a block of hotel rooms. The house is beautiful inside and out, and large enough for multiple fisherman to stay. Plenty of parking for 4 or 5 boats. The pool in the back was a fantastic plus. After running a large tournament multiple days, it was nice to just be able to relax in the afternoons. Will 100% book again next time I’m in Okeechobee."

Stayed with a pet","The breakfast, fruit and treat items were perfect after driving such a long way. It was nice to have a pool during the heat of the day. The many beds were accommodating for our large family. Location is great for the lake and proximity to town for goods. Plenty of parking too for our large family, which was perfect. The carport is nice to be able to shelter from the sun rays during the day while enjoying the pool, as well as hang out at night. The dog stuff was a cute addition, although we did not use. Overall, the house was very accommodating and it was easy to get a hold of the owner. Thank you for allowing us to stay in your vacation home!"

Had a special time swimming, playing with the provided board games, fishing a few minutes down the road. And what a blessing, we arrived to breakfast provided, didn't have to run to the store until the next day. I highly recommend - we will def return."

Group trip","Fishermen Friendly!!!!!! What a great house for people to bring their boats and enjoy an Okeechobee fishing vacation. There were added outlets on the side of the house for plugging batteries on boats up at night, a fish cleaning station, and extra freezer space in the garage for freezing your daily catch to pack and take home when you are heading home. Parking was not an issue. There was plenty of space for four boats and four trucks.
Garr was a great host. He was very attentive, always quick to respond and wanted you to have to best trip and stay while you vacationed in Okeechobee.
This will definitely be the house we look for when booking a trip for a large group and will also look for other properties that this host has to offer."

Thanks to Garr we enjoyed breakfast and dessert the whole Weeknd! Thank you! Will definitely be back when we can stay longer and enjoy your home for a longer time! Not to mention he home is decorated for fall better than I have got done yet. We travel a lot and these are the touches we look for. That make you come back and tell your friends.

Group trip","We absolutely love Garr’s home, the space, the appliances, the location, the attention to detail on every level, the quiet and peacefulness, there is really nothing one could not love about this home, nor Garr himself! Our family arrived from Puerto Rico and our home we originally rented was no longer available which had us in a hotel for a few days which is very tight with a large family. I felt an instant connection to Garr before I even spoke to him and I reached out to see if he could work with us and within seconds he sent us a special offer with no hesitation and has been the most helpful host I’ve ever encountered!! No matter the request he was able to accommodate us! Garr was also extremely clear in communication and that is very important to us!! My favorite part about Garr is his connection to God and following what God calls him to do!! We appreciate Garr and his home so much!! We just left but we are headed back next week to stay again that’s how much our family loves this home and experience, it just feels like HOME to us!!"
