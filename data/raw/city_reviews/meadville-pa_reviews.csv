Stayed one night",Pat & Tom are fabulous hosts. Every little detail in their home was well appointed and clearly done with great attention to detail. It was absolutely spotlessly clean and fresh. We enjoyed learning the history of the home as well. We already booked for a second visit and are certain this will be our home away from home when we visit our son and his family in Meadville.

Stayed one night","This stay was the best part about our weekend in town for a wedding. The host were so polite and accommodating. The location was great, parking was great, the yard and property are incredibly maintained and the space is really just quaint and pleasant. I recommend Davenport cidary for evening drinks like 10-12 minutes away. All in all a really nice airbnb that feels like a proper bnb. The host got an iron and ironing board out and ready for me and since our rental car was electric they setup an extension cord so I could top it off over night while we slept. (I don’t recommend relying on 110 charging if you have a rental electric car go to a charging station and don’t rely on your host to provide this for you! They were just helping us in a bind) I don’t know these host personally but they were inviting like your own parents would be. 10/10

Stayed one night","We were in town for graduation at Allegheny College, so there were three generations staying in, or stopping by Gene's place. There was plenty of room for all of us and everyone felt comfortable. The kitchen has everything you need to prepare a meal and then some. For the coffee lovers, there is a keurig and a coffee press. The basics were so well stocked that we thought other members of our party had brought items supplied by our host. Gene was very responsive to questions both prior to and during our stay. It is clear that he cares about providing a nice place to stay as well as a good experience. We wish all hosts were as caring as Gene and all properties as nice as his."

Stayed with a pet","The house welcomed us in with a table set for dinner, snacks and breakfast foods in the refrigerator, plenty of space downstairs to spread out for 6 adults. Disappointed that we were not allowed to use fireplace as we had cold nights to enjoy it, but understandable. The kitchen was perfect for multiple stations and people to prepare a holiday meal. Plenty of cookware and utensils. The yard was great for the dogs and the Creek provided a lovely backdrop and gentle sound. We were looking for a meeting point for our extended family to share Thanksgiving together and this fit our needs well. Gene was a great host available and quick to respond. Two separate table areas allowed a spot to play games together. Wonderful few days."

Stayed one night","Deborah’s room was clean, spacious and comfortable. Checking in was easy and Deborah was very accommodating and pleasant. There’s a little kitchenette, a nice sized private bathroom, small couch and double/queen sized bed that was comfy. And a dresser for your clothes.
It is a lower/basement type room and there was a hint of dampness in the air upon arrival but Deb had a dehumidifier running that quickly cleared that up. Private Access to the room is around the back through the yard. A walkway would be ideal but not a deal breaker.
I was in Meadville on business and Deborah was helpful in giving me directions to where I needed to be. I didn’t get much leisure time due to work but all in all I enjoyed staying at Deb’s place and will absolutely stay again if I find myself out that way.
I definitely recommend Deborah’s space to a solo or couple traveling through the area."

Stayed with a pet","My first time staying in a host's home. Deb's basement apartment is spacious, comfortable., and beautiful - very tastefully decorated and clean. The mattress was AMAZING, I think the most comfortable I've ever slept on in an airbnb. Although surprisingly the pillows aren't great, but I always bring my own :) The fireplace was a nice touch. Walking down through the yard to the outside entrance wasn't bad at all but might be dicey in the winter. There is noticeable noise of footsteps above, but the dehumidifier running helps cover that. (Note that it's best to empty the dehu bucket before bedtime, so it doesn't reach full during the night. Then you get loud beeps and dead silence which I learned the first night and then forgot to do the second night - my bad! I look forward to staying again!"

Stayed one night","Deborah was super friendly and a fantastic host. She was extremely flexible with my 11:30PM check in, as I was unable to arrive any sooner. The accommodated space was spotless clean, very homey, and quiet. Bed was comfortable, extra linens and towels were provided too. Private patio space outside of the private entry door was a nice bonus, and if I was staying longer than one night, would’ve spent a lot of time out there, as her landscaping and flowers on the property are beautiful and very well kept. Would definitely stay here again! Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","Deborah is such a wonderful host! She communicated very quickly and was very proactive when all of a sudden a storm came through and knocked the power out. She was quick to offer flashlights and candles. She was apologetic but it was really Mother Nature’s doing. She is so polite and kind. I would definitely recommend staying at her place if needing a place in Meadville or surrounding area. Very convenient to 19, 86, I-79. I would be careful if suffer from knee issues as getting in and out of bed was a little problematic since so low to floor. But she shows pictures, I just didn’t pay attention to those kind of details. The living area was so cute and she has a detailed page how to work the tv. The kitchenette was well stocked. She even had a little basket of snacks and a pitcher of water in mini fridge. She has toiletries in the bathroom just in case. Checking out was just as easy as checking in. Great place and superb hostess. Thank you for the weekend of respite!"

This time I was the only one who stayed and I felt safe and secure and enjoyed my stay immensely and the fireplace was amazing since it was so cold in Meadville. We have already booked with her for July and I am sure we will be staying there many more times over the years. I was able to spend some time talking with Deborah which I also enjoyed. She is a very nice lady. Thank you Deborah for everything and I look forward to seeing you in July.

Deborah was kind and responsive and we are happy to know we have a place to stay at whenever we visit family again. One thing to note is you can hear people walking around upstairs but it didn’t bother us at all. Thanks Deborah!

Stayed a few nights","It was a basement apartment. The room was about 25 by 15 with a separate bathroom and walk-in closet. WE used the separate entrance door that required walking around back. I think the garage was available, but we didn't need it. I think if you use the garage you can walk in and go straight downstairs. The place was very clean. Loved the bed! Very comfortable. There was a dehumidifier running full time, so there was no musky smell. The place is simply the best value if you are looking for a place to sleep and run around from. I will try and stay there again next time I am in the area. I would recommend it to anyone."

The only item I can point out for other guests to consider if this may be an issue for you is that, being a basement apartment, you can hear just the regular walking about the house above you. This was not a problem for me but could be for others. Other than that, there is NO problem with noise as the neighborhood was very quiet."

Stayed about a week","Deborah’s basement bedroom with a private bathroom is quite roomy and there is a separate entrance that opens up to a concrete pad below the back deck. There is a comfy couch and coffee table too.
Because the space is in the basement, there is some noise from the floor above. The walking and creaking began around 7am. Also, there was a pump noise from an adjacent room that came on periodically, but not for too long. I recommend ear plugs if you are a late sleeper. Early risers... no worries.
The walk to the driveway along the side of the house is through the grass and there is a slope. I suspect the walk would be untenable in snowy conditions. And you will need to use your phone’s light if making the walk at night.
The bed is comfortable although four pillows would have been nicer than the three we had. Oh, and there is WiFi. The bathroom is well lit and a decent size. Don’t freak out if the hot water in the tub/shower seems out. The hot is on the right.
There were some breakfast snacks at the coffee station, which was nice. The fridge was a bit too cold and the creamer in there was frozen.
Overall, Deb is an excellent communicator and her place is roomy, very clean and has a very convenient separate entrance. Also, her pricing is very reasonable. There is some noise from above and from the water system, but early risers will have no issue with that."

There's a big field across from the end of the street where I walked my dog and saw others doing so also.
If you are out and about, do go to Casey's Candies & Ice Cream in Meadville for some very yummy ice cream. I also found a lovely municipal park, Roche Park, that was very quiet and clean that had a one mile walking trail that my dog and I enjoyed before our ice cream stop."

The private bathroom was wonderful and everything was stocked - including small breakfast options that I was not expecting, as well as the option to make coffee. The price was phenomenal for the privacy. No hotel could have offered as much as I was told by my travelling companions. Deborah was also VERY pleasant and did not mind my late and early hours."

Stayed a few nights","Staying at Deb's place was great! We were working in the area and we found Deb's place to suit all of our needs! At first, we were a little confused about the key situation. It did say ""self check in"" which, my fault, I assumed meant there would be a lock box and a code would be sent to me like the last one we stayed at. Deb clarified quickly for us that we just needed to grab the key from her upon arrival. No issues!
Once there, we met Deb and her precious little dog, and got the key and unloaded!
We had a few notes (ones that I always note for others in case it may be an issue), but nothing that we had a problem with:
-the bathroom door stuck a little, but with a little force, you can close and lock the door.
-during some times, you can hear footsteps upstairs.
-at night, the house IS in a quieter area, so you MAY need to bring a sound machine if quiet bothers you.
Otherwise, we were very grateful that Deb helped us with a personal accommodation that we had last minute!
Would recommend!"

It was nice to have a spot to take off your shoes before venturing into the rest of the house. We didn’t have much chance to use the living room with its modern couch and funky rocking chair. The steep stairs were a challenge until we figured out to boy wearing socks, and turn our feet sideways! Upstairs bedrooms have comfortable beds, storage and are beautifully decorated. The small, single bathroom was a bit of a squeeze for four people trying to get out of the house in the morning.
The shower was narrow, but amply supplied with shampoo, conditioner, body wash. The toilet seat is particularly small - due to the size of the bathroom, no doubt. The location is convenient, plenty of parking on a quiet street, and a gorgeous tree shaded lot. We’d gladly stay here again."

There were no outside pictures of the home when I booked and that made me a little uneasy. There was no reason to be uneasy though because it’s a beautiful well kept home. Hidden by a tree lined front yard. The little yard in front is a nice space for walking a dog. Seemed like a nice safe area to walk to restaurants close by- I didn’t because it rained during my whole stay. There is a nice little fire pit area set up on the other side of the concrete driveway.
There were many personal touches that made the host stand out from leaving us a nice handwritten welcome note to leaving us snacks. We appreciated it all very much and made us feel welcome."

Group trip","Our stay was amazing! The place was very clean, well stocked, and cutely decorated! You could tell that everything in the house was thoroughly cleaned and well-maintained. There were complimentary snacks set out for us upon arrival. Even the next door neighbor, Mr. Jones, welcomed us and was very friendly. It was the perfect place to spend the weekend at, driving back and forth to Edinboro University for the Highland games. There were several restaurants nearby, including a Tim Horton’s! The town was very cute and felt safe. I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone and we will definitely be back in the future!"

Stayed with a pet","Wow. Might be a lengthy review, but this place was great. The first thing you will notice is the cleanliness of the home along with the gorgeous way it is decorated. It’s the very definition of cute, chic, & homey.
The second thing you notice are the sweet touches Hannah has put in for her guests, down to the very snacks she left for us to munch on (chips, granola bars, cereal, candy, tea!) to the little notes around the home.
Hannah made herself available to us anytime we needed it. We were sadly coming back to Meadville for my Aunt’a funeral, & Hannah accommodated us with early check-in so we could get ready prior to the visitation after a 10 hour drive from NC.
Additionally, while we normally stay with family, I was bringing my senior dog this time, & my family here has cats that do not get along with dogs- thus, we needed an AirBnB. The home & neighborhood has ample yardage for a dog to explore & play. Sometimes you can tell if an AirBnB allows pets because it smells like animals- not Hannah’s home. It smelled amazing!!
Another thing we loved was the lock pad on the door- we felt secure & it was nice not to carry around an actual key to the home.
Finally, the neighbors are the sweetest. Mr. Jones lives in the home next door- he is so friendly, welcomed us back to Meadville, & offered sincere condolences.
We definitely will be staying here anytime we’re back in town. Thank you, Hannah!"

Stayed a few nights","Great value for a nice house (actually bottom floor of an over/under duplex)! It had pretty much everything we needed for our stay. It could use some more lamps, especially in the bedroom I stayed in because the overhead light was way too bright for evening and there was no lamp.
As always, I explored as much of the house as I could, and I found a scary situation in the basement right below where we stayed. The flue on the gas water heater had come apart on both ends, so all the exhaust gases were pouring right into the basement, where they no doubt found their way into the living space above. I managed to reconnect it, but it needs attention from a professional who can fasten it with screws since it had none when I discovered the problem."

Stayed with a pet","My family of 3 and our pooch had a very nice weekend stay at this sweet unit in Meadville. It’s nicely decorated, thoughtfully equipped, and very homey. Living room had lots of comfy and attractive seating and it was a cozy place to hang out, and we loved the natural wood trim and details throughout the place. Since we were just there for a few days, we didn’t cook any real meals, but the kitchen was well equipped and we could have easily made a nice dinner if we had wanted to. Matt was very responsive to any questions and proactive about sharing instructions and checking in with us to make sure we had everything we needed. He had great suggestions for take out the first night (Mannino’s pizza) and we had a nice pub grub meal at Julian’s the second night (a busy Saturday, so we were glad we had reserved a table)."

Matt is an awesome host - readily available by phone and very proactive toward any issues. The home is very clean and well-kept with extra steps being taken to sanitize in light of today's health concerns. It is animal friendly, and our two dogs are very comfortable here. The housekeeper showed us linens that can be used to cover the usual white bedding and we bring extra furniture coverings as well. We truly love this place and would recommend it highly."

It was the perfect location for where we needed to be and accommodated our needs above and beyond! The house is spotless clean and immaculate. Very well stocked kitchen with good quality items that made you feel at home, not at a temporary rental. We loved all the extra rooms and spaces for gathering and sitting to visit and play games or have your morning coffee. They paid a lot of attention to detail with each of the rooms and you can feel it. Would love to stay there again if we need to!"

Group trip","Our family found this house to be a warm and welcoming retreat, providing the ideal space for us to gather around the kitchen table, share meals, and connect. Its proximity to restaurants and stores, satisfying my mom's Tim Hortons coffee cravings, was a convenient perk, while the private setting allowed us to come and go without any disruption.
The picturesque scenery added a delightful backdrop to our coffee moments. The house was thoughtfully stocked with everything we could possibly need, including practical items like an iron and hairdryer, and the cleanliness was impeccable. Even with a baby in tow, the comfortable linens and baby-friendly environment made for a worry-free stay.
Paula's sweetness and proactive communication further enhanced our experience. A solid 10/10 recommendation – it truly exceeded our expectations!"

To be fair though it was early in the morning when I noticed and I did not have time to reach out to Marion to ask about it or fix the situation.
It is a simple no frills place but very serviceable for a quick weekend. There is a full fridge, microwave, 2 burner stove and toaster oven. Marion very nicely left scones, yogurt, strawberries and juice in the fridge. I would stay again when I am in the area."

Marion was responsive, attentive to our needs, and accommodating of my odd travel constraints as they pertained to my check-in time in particular. The apartment was located within a convenient driving distance of downtown Meadville, and not a bad walking distance either. All in all, it was a great place to stay."

There is A/C in the living room and on a hot day it's quite comfortable in that room. But that is the only A/C in the apartment. The bedroom and kitchen were quite warm even with the living room A/C running. This isn't a complaint but just a heads up to others if you might be staying on a hot day. We ended up having to cut our trip short for personal reasons but if we had slept the night we would have slept on the living room futon instead of the bedroom just due to A/C. Otherwise I thought the space was perfectly fine."

Stayed with kids",An Old Victorian house with all the odd corners and narrow steeper stairs you’d expect! An apartment snuggled into the second floor with wonderful children’s stories on the shelf and if you as lucky as we were fresh baked goods to sample. Near (a good hilly walk) to the college and Lucy’s laundry. Don’t forget to visit Kettle Lake Kitchen for the best tasty food in Meadville (old Market House location).

Stayed a few nights","Excellent place to stay, in an upstairs apartment. It felt loved. Very well furnished in the kitchen (plates, bowls, mugs, glassware, flatware, pots & pans, etc.). We enjoyed with many good foods (fruit, oatmeal, etc.) and fixings for hot drinks that she left for us. We especially enjoyed the zucchini bread that Marion baked special for us. The microwave oven takes a bit longer to cook, due to lower Watts than at our house. The shower worked well, the bedroom was spacious with a bed light. We really appreciated the air conditioner in the living room. We also have This End Up couches at home, but this is the first one I've seen with a foldout bed. The garage supports charging up (slowly) our electric car, very handy."

She also was very friendly and talked with us both on our way in and out. The rooms were in an upstairs apt, so you do need carry items up a tight staircase. Older house so a little drafty but there were plenty of blankets. There is no tv, however there are a few books and games I loved all of the little touches in the kitchen that made the space feel homey. We had a lovely stay and would definitely stay again if we are in the area."

Bed was a little hard for our taste, but everything else was really comfortable. Marion provided us with scones, milk, cereal, coffee, oatmeal packets - more than we expected for an easy breakfast in the room. The place is small, as described, but thoughtfully arranged and quite comfortable. I'd go back in a heartbeat."

I park my car in the provided garage space and leave it there until I'm ready to leave Meadville. Marion always leaves homemade fresh baked goods, all the coffee/tea supplies you need and other breakfast/snack food. This accommodation is very thoughtful. There are always extra towels and blankets, generous amounts of toilet paper. I've never felt that supplies are 'rationed'. We typically cook at least 1 meal/day during our stays. The kitchen has everything you need to cook basic meals. This is becoming out home away from home when in Meadville. Thanks Marion!"

The apartment itself was clean. I have stayed in other AirB&Bs that were more homey and well-appointed. If this were a hotel property based on five stars, it would be a 2-3 star property in terms of amenities and overall feel. It’s more like the feel of a motel. I travel extensively and that’s what it felt like to me — solid but very basic. Unlike most hotels, however, Marion provided wonderful homemade bread and great breakfast options in the fridge."

We will definitely re-book if ever in the area again!

But Marion herself won us over. She was so gracious and thoughtful--leaving whole milk in the fridge since she knew we were traveling with our toddler.

The house is just that, an old Victorian, but very warm and comfortable, not over done. Marion provided us with everything you could ask for, even baking blueberry scones a nice treat to go along with the hot chocolate for my son. A simple fruit basket was also welcomed after long day of travel. Our family would absolutely stay again with our next visit and would recommend her place to anyone traveling."

There were some toys and books for young children, which my son enjoyed. There is no television or toiletries — not a criticism, just an FYI to pack accordingly. But if you forget anything or want to cook, local grocery stores are nearby. The hosts welcomed us with a personal handwritten note, which was a nice touch.
Our visit was short (eclipse weekend!) and we spent much of our time out of the house, which is why my review is short. We enjoyed our stay."

I thought we would be lost not having a TV there but they had lots of toys for my 4yo and many games and puzzles for us which was just what we needed! We connected and where unplugged for those few days! It was perfect! My teenagers didn’t even mind not watching the tube! It was a quiet neighborhood which made it easy to relax. I would say bring your lawn chairs and sit out by the fire pit. We didn’t bring any and they offered us theirs!! So sweet!! Unlike some Airbnb’s where you have to bring your own TP and bedding, Townhouse on Lord had everything you need and so neatly organized! They even had a diffuser on when we walked in, so it smelled wonderful.
We had a wedding so really have no need to go back there BUT might make up a reason just to stay again!! It was incredibly enjoyable and we wish we could’ve stayed longer!"

Every amenity was provided: fully-appointed and well-stocked kitchen, ample outdoor seating, and an inviting firepit set within the trees. We made some great memories here: we spotted many deer and heard much wildlife, my dad taught my daughter how to fish in the pond, we heard owls while sitting around the firepit, and we even saw a bald eagle fly over. We were able to have a very relaxing and peaceful family getaway. I imagine the property would be breathtaking in the fall with the changing of the leaves. We all loved it so much we hope to return next year!"

Group trip","Overall it was a great place to stay. This home is clean, spacious, and comfortable. Adam and Kaitlyn were very responsive to our messages both leading up to our stay and during our stay. We did have to contact them when we arrived because we hadn’t received the code for the lockbox. They responded quickly and we were able to get right in. One thing we would recommend to folks that are planning on staying here is you should grab some drinking water before you get there because the water smells like sulfur. Keep in mind that there is an additional cleaning fee if you have visitors, which was not mentioned in the booking process."

Group trip","Beautiful, clean and updated house. ! Tastefully decorated w thought put into details. Perfect for my family of 6 as we came to the area for our daughter's wedding; extremely convenient, 8 min from wedding venue. The 4 bedrooms gave the perfect amt of privacy . The kitchen was immaculate and a bonus was the fully stocked laundry room w ironing supplies. Loved the entry / mudroom, a great place to organize your grab and go supplies.
Caveats: the step from the mud room up into the house was a little high for my elderly mom. Hand rails would have been helpful for stairs too .
Wish we would have been able to hang at the house longer ( nice large family room for conversations) but was ideal for what we needed; family coming from 3 diff states for wedding. Super responsive, accommodating hosts! Recommend!"

We didn’t have time to explore the town of Meadville but did grab some lunch at The Whole Darn Thing sub shop and they were hands down the best we’ve ever had! Very cute town and definitely worth returning so we can explore more.
Thanks for being responsive hosts and providing such a beautiful place to stay. And for the extra special touches🥰"

Stayed with kids","We had several family members coming into town for a wedding. The cottage was only 7 minutes from the venue and offered a relaxing and comfortable atmosphere for our families to make lasting memories. We had a few questions upon our arrival, the hosts answered immediately. The cottage was recently renovated and was updated beautifully. The beds were comfortable and freshly cleaned. Because the kitchen was stocked with all the basic items needed, we enjoyed several home cooked meals. We also enjoyed using the grill and fire pit (they provide wood). The cottage doesn't have central air but the two window units and fans seemed adequate for our stay. There was plenty of parking for our multiple cars as well. We highly recommend and would stay here again if we are ever in the area."

The place was clean and spotless and they had everything we needed. I was concerned when I realized they didn’t have central air conditioning but a window unit in the upstairs bedroom and one on the main floor. But to my surprise, we were very comfortable both day and night with the temperatures outside in the mid eighties the entire time we stayed in their home. THANK YOU, Adam and Kaitlyn for opening your beautiful home to us so we could continue making new memories."

Lovely decor and cute little firestarters for the campfire! Only very small issue was that there were only 2 bathrooms with 9 of us and we couldn't shower all of us in a timely manner/without running out of hot water, but with some planning, we were fine and it was still worth the stay! Definitely recommend."

We arrived late, but it was easy to check in, and the house made us smile from the second we walked in. It was so clean and had all the things we needed- to include a wine opener and coffee for the morning. We went outside to have a glass of wine after a long drive, and were amazed at the cacophony of magical nature sounds coming from the bullfrogs and birds. When we went back inside, however, it was quiet and relaxing. I only wish we had discovered this home earlier in our journeys. Thank you for a wonderful stay."

Our group of 3 families with small children had plenty of room for dinner, games and crafts. Everyone slept comfortably and checkout was easy. My only complaint is that the lighting throughout the kitchen, dining and living room areas are super bright and kind of harsh first thing in the morning. The only floor lamp in the living room was burnt out, so an additional low light source or a hall nightlight would’ve been clutch, but other than that everything was great!"

Group trip","While initially I wanted to leave them a good review, my thoughts have changed based on how we were treated after our stay. Things were going great in the beginning, however, upon leaving the house and driving back to Ohio, I was greeted with a message two days later at 5pm saying that my group violated house rules due to their cleaning lady finding pet hair. For some context, myself, as well as the other guests have pets at home, and most of us work at a small animal vet clinic. Based on this information, pet hair will inevitably travel with us. Not only did we find accommodations to have our pets watched in our home state 3.5 hours away, one guest has a service dog and elected not to bring him based on house rules and the fact that there would be 4 other people to help her if needed. When I got the first message this evening (10/18/22 at 3:30pm) I was told that we violated house rules and that the cleaning lady had to actually clean the house instead of apparently just doing a spot clean. So not only were we wrongly accused, but it seems as though they don't launder the blankets and sheets on a regular basis? Safe to say we will not be staying at their house in the future due to this experience."

There's also plenty of easy parking for 2-4 cars. The only downside for was a lack of dressers and tabletop space in all the bedrooms and bathrooms. We stayed in the area for a wedding and would have appreciated more space to better unpack and organize ourselves. You should also know the home uses well water. This isn't a big deal, but it's worth noting in case you want to buy water in advance."

Stayed with kids","Adam and Kaitlyn were as amazing as their home. This was my first experience with an Airbnb. We decided Meadville PA was the half way point between our friends in NJ and us from Indiana. We were super happy with the communications of Adam and Kaitlyn , the beautiful home they let us stay in, along with the town of Meadville.
Adam and Kaitlyn were super responsive from the beginning of our booking to the end our stay. Any questions we had were answered quickly.
The home itself it’s absolutely beautiful and you can still smell the newness of their remodel they did to the house. We needed a place the slept our two families a group of 10. After looks at halfway point this was our selection. It had plenty of space for everyone. We felt the home was very specious. You can tell they put a lot of work into the remodel. We went and googled the address. Google still had a picture of what it looked like before the remodel was done. So it was actually cool to see kinda before and after pictures.
Amenities:
We used the grill once to make some cheeseburgers and it worked well. Had to start it with a lighter, but that was provided at the house. The inside of the house had plenty of room for the kids to play. We also bought toys for the yard which has a lot of space to play. Kaitlyn and Adam were kind to turn on the water so we could fill a small kiddie pool up with water. We used the fire pit two of the nights and made s’mores. Kaitlyn and Adam have a great stock pile of wood to use, so you don’t have to go hunting firewood and are able to enjoy the fire pit right away.
The Town:
The town of Meadville actually was really nice. Restaurants, good coffee shop, farmers market (on saturdays), and little shops all within 5-10 minute drive. We really enjoyed the restaurant Julian’s and the French Roast coffee shop.
Thank you Adam and Kaitlyn for letting us stay at your home. We made some great memories."

Space was a good fit for my group of three. The apartment is part of a duplex, and at first it was a little hard to tell which door to use. The duplex ""neighbor"" came out and cleared our deck and steps of snow several times throughout the weekend. Because of the weather, we mostly stayed indoors, but we did enjoy the walking trail between the river and the train tracks."

As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a pristinely maintained, very clean, fresh scents, and just the right amount of technology (smart tvs and ~300 Gbps internet). The air conditioning is AMAZING! I am perpetually hot and the central air, not window units, deserves 5 stars by itself!
Finally we accidentally left a pillow that wasn’t cheap but more importantly is key for my wife to get a good nights sleep. Normally we would not have seen it again. However, Elizabeth contacted us, went out of her way to arrange for our friends to pick it up for us. It may seem small but what she did meant the world to us.
We would definitely stay again, but next time we will triple check to make sure we don’t leave anything behind! 😁"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I came here right after our wedding. This cabin was perfect for relaxation and for remembering and locking in all the highlights of our wedding. We sat out on the porch as much as possible, enjoyed the hot tub and fire pit. I also enjoyed the gas fireplace, it was perfect to nap infront of. We brought our bikes and found the quiet roads perfect for ride around. The cabin is well built and really provides privacy without being too far from store for basic odds and ends. Will be recommending this spot to other couples who need a getaway."

Stayed a few nights","Quiet, peaceful, and clean.
Very pleasant and thoughtfully laid out; an excellent use of available space.
It was incredibly clean!
If you’re looking for a quiet and private retreat, this fits the bill nicely.
Some caveats:
Access to the second floor, where the only bed is, is by a staircase that is basically like a ladder. If you have mobility issues it will be inaccessible.
The hot tub was well serviced but it is on a pad not covered by a roof- inclement weather will keep you from using it.
Not good or bad, just more info:
The tap water has a strong iron taste and smell, typical for well water in this area.
The decorations are very Christian centric, for some people this is a positive, for those who are not Christian it may be off putting.
The property is on a dirt road, it doesn’t require 4WD drive, but I’d be careful in snow or rain.
We had excellent cell service on the AT&T network."

The issues we had were we couldn't find the firewood, it should be listed where it is for people. Jonathan emailed me back the next day informing me where it was, which was fine we ended up not having a fire. The fire pit needed cleaned out and we just decided to spend more time inside together.
Sunday morning went to have coffee on the porch and there were 2 dogs running loose around the property at Sweet Solitude.
It was a relaxing weekend still to try to reconnect with one another."

Located far enough out you’re on your own but close enough to shopping food and even a trip up to Erie and the beaches.
You won’t be disappointed if you’re looking for some alone time.
Pictures do this place justice except for how extremely quiet it is out there.
This cabin is smaller but the memories are huge!
This place was exactly what I needed for a little weekend To relax and forget about everything.
Lots of items stocked and available for use.

The couch was super comfortable and the gas fireplace, while a little confusing to run, was really cool and heated the place well. The cabin was well-stocked with thoughtful little amenities like toothbrushes, bottled water, and K-Cups. One item to note— the staircase up to the bedroom in the loft is more like a ladder and is steeper and more difficult to climb than we expected. Could be a little unsafe for people with any limited mobility, so just something to keep in mind. It was a wonderful stay!"

Stayed a few nights","This sweet little cabin was exactly what we needed for our anniversary weekend! It is off the beaten path, mostly secluded, adorable, VERY clean, and fully stocked. Host is super attentive via the app in case you need anything at all. We enjoyed exploring the local towns, Pymatuning State Park, Erie, and Presque Isle - all very convenient from this cabin. I have already recommended this place to numerous friends & we will 100% come back in the future!"

Stayed a few nights","I am beyond happy with this stay! This was my first Air BnB Experience and it was fantastic. I was so happy on arrival. We are from Pittsburgh and it was a short ride and great price for an anniversary unwind! Very private! Cozy, Adorable! Hot Tub was private and relaxing, full Kitchen and Grill made this ""camping"" a ""glamping"" experience. Fire pit was perfect for mountain pies and s'mores. They provide fire wood and propane, everything you need. Slept Like a baby! So Clean. fireplace inside was a wonderful touch. Great Lighting for how dark it is outside at night. AC Unit in the window kept me happy at the hottest part of the days. Would visit again! Use the Swing! Highly recommended!"

Stayed a few nights","This little place was perfect. We were looking for somewhere to get away, relax, and unwind while spending quality, uninterrupted time together and that’s just what we got. When we arrived, the cabin was very clean and just as it was pictured. The new hot tub was an added bonus. We also were welcomed with a sweet treat that was a special added touch. We couldn’t have been more happy with our stay and everything about Jonathan’s place. We had a great time and look forward to being able to visit again in the future. If you’re looking for a secluded, quiet, special little getaway place.. you won’t be disappointed."

Stayed a few nights","My boyfriend and I came to the cabin for a bit of a retreat for my birthday weekend- this cabin was absolutely perfect. There was more to do than we expected and some great food options in Meadville. The cabin itself was adorably decorated and had everything we needed- including a corkscrew, k-cups, and creamer! The loft was more spacious than we expected and the fireplace was so cozy. The carport was also extremely convenient since it snowed quite a bit while we were there. Very secluded- we felt like we were in our own little world. This place was even better than the pictures!"

Stayed one night","A Much Needed Getaway!
Wow! This place is one of a kind! My son and I were looking for a place to stay while checking out some of the local trails. This place exceeded our expectations! The cabin was one of the cleanest places I have ever stayed. The decor, the lighting, the fireplace, and even the comfortable quality furniture is like a page out of a magazine. All the little details were taking care of ( we loved the Blackberry pie waiting for us when we got there). We honestly cannot wait to stay in the Spring when the weather is a little warmer!"

It was easy to find and check in was very smooth. Nice clean kitchen if you want to spend some time cooking. Fireplace is perfect and easy to use.
We went in winter which was very cozy but the yard is pretty big for playing games and having a fire in the outdoor pit when the weather is warmer."

Stayed one night","The cabin is a fairy tale. There are many ways to adjust the lights. There was a treat on the table for us when we came in. The cabin is so clean that it looks brand new. Shampoos, soaps, toothbrushes, and even dental floss were provided. Coffee and creamer were available also. There are plenty of dishes and even a nice cast iron pan. There is a convenient sink up in the loft at the top of the stairs, and there is one under the stairs as well. The temperature was very warm and comfortable. There is a ceiling fan in the kitchen and one in the loft. The bed is super cozy. Everything is high quality. It is a dream. You will love it!"

Stayed one night","Wow, just wow! This place is as advertised- fantastic private location but close enough to the state parks and downtown Meadville. I didn’t see anyone from the moment I pulled in and I wanted it that way. Privacy is key! The place was immaculate, clean, well-stocked, everything I needed for a solo getaway from the city. Quiet and comfortable. Jonathan was easy to work with, friendly, and responsive. I recommend this to couples looking for a romantic excursion or to friends wanting to reconnect or even to solo vacationers hoping for some peace and solitude. A+++."

Stayed a few nights","The cabin is exactly what we were looking for! Very secluded, in the middle of the woods, but still close enough to all of the things to do in Meadville or Conneaut Lake. The electronic reclining love seat in the living room was very comfortable and the gas fireplace which was connected to a thermostat was perfect for keeping the cabin warm and cozy when the weather turned cooler on the 2nd day of our stay. Cabin was very clean, and perfect for our anniversary get away. I would recommend to anyone trying to escape for a special occasion."

Jonathan and Jennifer were very accommodating (we booked it just a few hours before check in), they were friendly and even left us a little heart shaped cake to celebrate!
The cabin is stocked full of everything you could possibly need for a stay! Just bring some food and s’mores, and you’re all set!"

We highly recommend this place!"

Stayed a few nights","I honestly didn’t know what to expect when I came to Jonathan’s Airbnb, but I was absolutely blown away in the best way possible. The property feels like something I would find in a fairy tale. The coziness of the cottage, unique entrance to the bedroom, and gorgeous condition of the house was everything I could want in a secluded getaway weekend for myself and my girlfriend. The place was stocked with tons of kitchen ware fir available use, which was a great touch. On top of all that, Jonathan was extremely accommodating and helpful with providing information on different things to do in the area. I most definitely will be returning to Jonathan’s amazing property and hospitality"
