Stayed a few nights","We loved everything about our stay! The place was spotless, the beds comfy, and the location was perfect for our stay since we were there for the NCAA Softball Regionals at AL. Plus, it was close to everything: the mall, restaurants, stores. The hosts were great at answering any questions I had and replied so quick when I sent a message. They have thought of everything you need, and it made our stay so nice and easy! Would definitely stay again and highly recommend this air bnb!"

Stayed with a pet",The cleaning service messed up their days so they didn’t make it before I showed up. But Ally offered to call the maids in and I said no since I was already there. She was very kind and apologetic and told me where I could find clean sheets and towels. She also refunded me some of the money for the inconvenience. The place was NOT a mess. It was simply just the sheets hadn’t been washed/changed and there weren’t clean towels out. I appreciated the transparency and the help. Would definitely stay again.

We also loved that they took the time to decorate for Christmas. It really made us feel cozy while traveling for the holidays. Would recommend this stay to anyone :)"

Quaint neighborhood within walking distance to downtown Northport’s shops and restaurants. David reached out to make sure I got in without a problem and made some recommendations for things to do and places to eat. The loft itself was comfortable and had everything I needed for the long hours of studying I had to do. If I come back to the area, I’d stay here again and make sure to spend a few extra days seeing the sights."

Stayed one night","I stayed here to break up a long drive. I left the following morning feeling considerably better than when I arrived. Must mean it’s a good airBnB. I enjoyed kicking back in the loft. Plans to go to Tuscaloosa for dinner were 86'd - the space was too comfortable to leave. I also liked the vintage rock motif, particularly the autographed photo of Richie Havens playing at Woodstock. I was growing up about 110 miles SE of that Bethel, NY event. I was a mere lad at the time - no chance my parents would have let me go - but it was nice to live vicariously. I did a deeper dive on Woodstock on the Internet and learned that Richie Havens kicked off the concert because the original opening act was stuck in traffic, that the gig meant much to Richie and his career, and, after his death, his ashes were spread over the concert site. The CSN poster reminded me of the first rock concert I ever saw - CSN at the late, lamented, never forgotten New Haven Coliseum. Thanks for the nostalgia & the stay!"

Stayed a few nights","A travel group I’m in is always posting horror stories about AirBnbs. This is NOT one of those stories! What you see is what you get at “The Shop.” If you are headed to Tuscaloosa, it is a great location a little bit away from the madness of McFarland (#iykyk) but still easy (and quick) to get to the University of Alabama. I love that it is in a peaceful area near a school, but it also has a Walgreens and Jack’s a couple of minutes away by car. The bed is super comfy, and I loved how spacious the shower and bathroom were. The snacks and KCups were such a nice touch; it’s one of the things that made it feel more like you were staying at a friend’s. Check in and check out are a breeze. The only bad thing is that you can’t stay forever."

It is an affordable living place located in a safe and quiet neighborhood with everything you need basically for an overnight stay. The location is not super closed to UA, but it’s only 15-20 mins drive to the campus, which is still convenient. Thank you Sandy & Mike!"

Stayed one night","Hi all, I hope this review finds you well. If you are coming across this spot looking for somewhere to stay, book it. Just book it. Sandy is a great host, friendly, understanding, and she made sure to stock the fridge with drinks, and leave snacks out. I had the option in the morning for coffee, oatmeal, grits. The wifi was fast, they even had a little heater for the bathroom which I loved because I’m always cold when I get out of the shower. Oh and the shower, it’s beautiful. Also, you know when you stay away from home you usually get a bed that’s mediocre. Not this bed. It’s so comfortable, I thought I’d have trouble sleeping being in a new spot but I was out like a light. It’s so homey feeling. The shop is clean, comfortable, beautiful neighborhood, super responsive friendly host, & for the price you can’t beat it. You’ll pay twice at a hotel with less amenities and less comfort & twice the hassle. Book ‘The Shop’ thank me later :)

The Shop has everything you need and then more… drinks, snacks, and other complimentary items as a nice touch. The Shop is in a nice quiet safe neighborhood, but near shopping and just a quick drive to see any of the Alabama sports teams. In fact, we were In town for a gymnastics meet on Friday and a basketball game the following Saturday. Definitely recommend The Shop and would love to stay here again next time we are in town. 5 stars and 2 thumbs up without question."

The shop is in a very nice neighborhood, behind the owner's home. It is a super cute and quiet place and you can't find a better price! There are drinks and snacks provided, as well as paper products, shampoos, hair dryer, etc. There were even instant grits, oatmeal, tea and hot chocolate! The bed is a bit squeaky if you turn a lot at night, but otherwise a wonderful stay! Sandy was very informative and friendly, giving us recommendations on local restaurants.

The washer/dryer was great to have. Liked the bedroom to the back with one queen bed with the closing doors in the hallway, and the private bathroom. You had your own space. User friendly television and just an awesome place.
Will definitely use again when we come back."

Group trip","Michael was a great host! The property was in a terrific location; safe and very walkable to the downtown area. The condo was clean and included small but helpful things like q-tips, trash bags, and even laundry pods and dryer sheets. Michael was easy to communicate with, and he was able to accommodate our early arrival, which was much appreciated after a very long day of traveling. Lastly, all three of the beds were incredibly comfortable. One of our guests described it as “like sleeping on a cloud.” The bed in the larger bedroom was seriously more comfortable than my bed at home! Bed quality is one detail that I always comb through reviews for, and trust me when I say that you will absolutely sleep well in this property, regardless of which room/bed you choose. We will definitely book Michael’s place again in the future! So glad we found it before our son begins at UA! :)"

Novice Airbnb users will find it super easy to check in and he has everything you need. Experienced Airbnb folks will appreciate the ease of check in and great communication. Sean does an amazing job of making sure his guests are taken care of. Look no further for a place to stay near the university if you're visiting your college student or going to game day. It's about 12 minutes from the heart of the university. There are several ways to get there, so use G**gle to avoid traffic. Generous check in time of 2pm and checkout by 11. Super clean. I appreciated the well organized kitchen area. Carport available for off street parking. Huge backyard that is fenced in! The beds are super nice! And he has blankets galore to make it feel just like home. I can't think of one valid complaint except maybe I wished I'd found it earlier."

As soon as we first entered we felt very welcome; there were even muffins waiting for us on the kitchen table! The attention to detail as far as the well-stocked kitchen and linens was impeccable. There was even a first aid kit and extra personal amenities (toothbrush, etc.) available. We did not want or need anything during our stay - it was all right there!

Sounds odd to say but what do I mean by that, it is pristine clean and no pet or previous pet visit odors. Sean is easy to access and promptly responds to any request. I felt safe and at home.

Chip and Joanna would be proud! There were fresh muffins on the table, plenty of ground or k-cup coffee with creamers, plenty of other extras as well. Just in case you forgot something, there were extra toothbrushes and toothpaste, shaving cream, soaps, feminine products, shampoo and conditioner, and bar soaps.
Location was perfect. Tucked into a quiet neighborhood. Away from all the university traffic and busyness but close enough to get to the sports activities quickly. A Walmart close by and one of the friendliest staffed Waffle Houses you will ever visit.
We are big Alabama fans and Sean’s place will be at the top of our preferred places to stay! Thanks Sean! ‘See you’ again soon!!"

One thing that would help is to have lamps in the bedrooms so overheat lightning isn’t as needed and to add another chair near the window in the living area for more seating. ☺️"

Sean added nice little personal touches to make us feel extra welcome and we really appreciate that. The home is also close to The University of Alabama which was perfect for us and our college day visit.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Sean’s home for your stay. If my daughter decides on the school out here, Sean’s home this will be our go to for every visit we make to see her!
Thank you Sean for helping make our stay wonderful !"

The furnishings were comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked. The beds were extremely comfortable (one even had an adjustable mattress.) The backyard was fenced in and the neighborhood was quiet and walkable. It was convenient to Walmart and many other stores and restaurants. I will definitely stay here again the next time I am in town.

Stayed over a week","Five stars because I can’t give more! My family and I stayed here 12/23-1/3 and agree this is where we want to stay when we’ll be in town. The pictures are truly represent the place you’re staying, Sean is helpful and hospitable, and you will be thrilled you chose to stay here.
We forgot one of our CPAPs back home, so my husband and I slept in separate rooms, meaning all three room were used during our stay and the beds are all very comfortable. The house has the right amount of everything you need – dishes, silverware, pots and pans, closet space, and more. We hosted a small party for our daughter’s 20th birthday and our guests said if they didn’t live locally, they’d want to stay here!
It helps that the neighborhood is really quiet, and is located extremely closely to a variety of restaurants, grocery stores, shopping centers, as well as Downtown Northport and Downtown Tuscaloosa, and the UA campus. Seriously, book it before someone else does!"

My stay was very last minute but from the time I hit confirm on Airbnb until the time I checked out Sean was in constant communication, giving me a periodic update on the home and the times I could checkin. Sean even went beyond the call of duty to send a Good Morning message with instructions on how to leave the home. To me this was great because I no longer needed to go back and find the checkout instructions."

The owners were very responsive and communicative. They should give a master class for Airbnb on how to decorate and run a place; everything was so convenient and well thought out.

We didn't communicate with our hosts while were were there, but that is because we didn't need too. Directions to get there and check-in were clear. I have family that lives in Tuscaloosa, so didn't need help finding anything in town.
Thank you for letting us stay in your tiny house!"

Stayed one night","Such a joy to stay in this tiny home!
Instructions and details prior to check in were so helpful and clear the start - I was especially impressed by how many little details had been thought through before even checking in. From specific parking details, local recommendations, and thoughtful amenities (bathroom products, snacks and waters, and personalized welcome notes.)
In addition to amazing hospitality, this tiny home is such a unique and peaceful getaway! Perfectly clean and tidy, cheerful and full of character, and so well-designed you don’t miss extra space. Bed was very comfortable and clean, and fully stocked kitchen utilities were a huge plus.
Hands down, best part is the historic preservation of a former grocery store. So many little touches nodding to its past, really lovely and well done!
If you want a unique and inviting stay not far from Tuscaloosa and other attractions - this is the place to be!"

Stayed with a pet","Kristi and William are the most amazing hosts and people and really made this trip to Tuscaloosa far better than I could have imagined. I’ve been staying in a lot of airbnbs lately for work and they’ve all been pretty average with little to no communication from the hosts. That is not the case here! The tiny home is definitely my favorite Airbnb I’ve stayed in.
The yard is huge and fenced in so my dogs could run around and play and they have a new dog best friend in Ollie, Kristi and Williams pup!
The tiny home is beautifully done and every detail has a personal touch to it. It is unique and very comfortable. I was a longer stay and there wasn’t anything missing for cooking, cleaning or toiletries. Perfectly stocked! It is located in the backyard with a view of their pretty garden and is set back away from the main house so it feels very private. If there was anything I needed, they were on it immediately. There is plenty of parking as well.
In all, I had a great stay and made new friends in Kristi and William. I highly recommend and will definitely come back!"

The apartment has everything you need, with very comfortable beds and a nice living room area. Grocery store a 5 min drive down the road. Very clean with an excellent host. We even swam in the condo pool and enjoyed some time in the sunshine during our vacation in February!"

If you are booking for the pool please note that the pool is not well maintained. It is well used by kids/teens that do not respect the property. This is no fault of the AirBNB owners. When called about a pool issue they called the maintenance man immediately. He came and tried to fix it, not for sure he really has a good grasp on the pool care."

I’m pleased to say it was just as it was advertised and even more. The hosts were extremely accommodating and helpful from the very beginning until the minute we checked out.
The couch was so comfortable and the television was large enough for everyone to see from the couch and the chairs. The water pressure and temperature were so on point. It was truly a home away from home.
The kitchen is fully equipped and very clean and easy to keep clean with supplies available in the unit. The washer and dryer were also a huge help with suds available.
The house rules were simple and easy to navigate. There were no move out instructions that made it hard to just pack up and leave at the end of our one week stay. Although we were not required to clean up, we had enough time to do so. Lovely home and lovely hosts!!"

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I just stayed at Esther this pass week. We needed a place close to DCH hospital in Tuscaloosa because my wife’s sister was hospitalized there. Esther’s location was perfect. 18 minutes away from the hospital, university of Alabama, restaurants and any possible place you can possibly need if you’re on vacations or in our case a family member hospitalized near by. Esther works with us in our indecisions of days and dates on our booking since my sister in law condition changed dramatically in a matter of days. After 16 hours of driving we arrived to a very pleasant place super clean and quiet in a beautiful neighborhood close to everything we could possibly need; gas, food, drugstore, restaurants etc…
This is our first experience with Airbnb and after this it won’t be the last. We recommend Esther as a host to anyone interested, she was great, great place and great location…
Sorry I couldn’t give you more stars since this review tops 5 but in our opinion she deserves 100 +"

Stayed a few nights","The room was a great deal for what I paid for. There was a ladybug problem. I killed no less than 50 ladybugs during my stay. Unfortunately the patio doors in the room were not properly sealed and they were coming through continuously. I contacted the host, and she gave me a vacuum with a hose to suck them up during my 4 night stay. This is not ideal when you are paying for a room, no matter the costs. She apologized and said this is an issue and they have sprayed the outside door. I finally had to buy tape and tape the seals of the door, which worked."

Esther even provided snacks, mouthwash and toothbrush, and shampoo and conditioner. I loved the little porch off of the bedroom. If you are headed to the University of Alabama, it is a short 15 minute drive —unless it’s football season. There is a Walgreens and CVS probably less than 5 minutes from the listing. Great location, comfortable digs, responsive host. I would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","The setting is in a very quiet neighborhood with a nice balcony and table set to enjoy the morning with a cup of coffee/tea. Thomas and Esther's space was spotlessly clean and offered a very relaxing place to come back to after a very busy day. While we were out one afternoon they called us to let us know there was a tornado warning for the area, and we were welcome to come back with our son from the university and use their shelter. We really appreciated the phone call to let us know about the alert. They are wonderful host, and it's very obvious they are committed in providing a comfortable place to stay. We will be back."

Suite was immaculate and has very nice touches that make it a personable experience. If I ever need a Airbnb in Tuscaloosa again Esther and Thomas will be my first search."

I was only in town for a weekend getaway, but their guest suite was exactly what I needed to unwind. I strung a hammock on the deck and got some sun with a good book; in the mornings, I had complimentary coffee, then hit the riverfront for brunch. It’s a lovely space – peaceful, well-located, and equipped with everything you need. Hoping to visit again."

It has a private entry, large bedroom, bathroom and closet, fridge, microwave, and lovely sitting area on the balcony. Esther is the perfect host with her quick communication, unexpected snacks and she seems to have anticipated every possible need."

Ester went about and beyond to accommodate me, and I am so grateful.
