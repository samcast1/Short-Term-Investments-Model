Stayed with a pet","What a charming & beautiful gem in the mountains. The view is stunning, we just sat on the patio and watched the mountains & the sun, the sunsets are breathtaking. The sound of the rushing waters below, coupled with the fresh mountain air is healing! What a lovely picturesque cabin, cozy and feels like home. Really close to Bushkill Falls and Alaska Pete's, two of my Pocono favorites. A wonderful trip, many thanks, Dawn!"

Her home was welcoming, clean, and had everything listed and described in the booking details. Supermarket not far for those who cook. Parking is good. I am grateful for her and her hosts. I enjoyed my stay. Will recommend. Thank you!!"

Stayed a few nights","Melissa is a great host and communicated very well with us leading up to the trip. The apartment was very clean and it's in an incredibly convenient location on Main Street with numerous eateries and pubs within walking distance and dedicated parking right across the street. The apartment is surrounded by other apartments (which might be other short-term rentals?) and at times there was excessive noise coming from some of those units (e.g., loud music, shouting, etc.). I would recommend bringing some earplugs or other sound cancelling devices if you book this apartment. Also, the mattress is very firm. It would greatly benefit from a mattress topper. Overall, the apartment is a good value given its location but I would look elsewhere if you are sensitive to noise or if a comfortable bed is a must have."

The only suggestion I’d add is to get a mattress topper because the bed was a little too firm for us. Thanks for a great stay!

Stayed a few nights","Great value and perfect for a weekend getaway to the Poconos. The apartment is located right on main street in Stroudsburg, a cute village with a great brunch cafe (cafe duet), wineries, good bars (like Sarah St Grill, which right behind the apartment building), awesome candy store, arcade, and boutiques. Location is super convenient. You are within 15 min driving to Shawnee mountain, and I believe there are other skiing/snowboarding options within 30 min away. Mellissa was fantastic with instructions and recommendations. The host group is super proactive and very helpful. I highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","The location is ideal both for the foodie wanting to enjoy a hopping downtown scene and still private with a great outside balcony for a peaceful meal. The place was very clean and sufficiently stocked and modern that I felt very comfortable. I tend to be picky when I get away so I was really pleased, although I found locating the apartment a bit confusing. You enter through a common business entrance on main street and are parking directly across the street. We had several bags so I wasn’t quite sure what to do. There is an easily accessible back door from the alleyway in the rear, elevated second floor deck. Although the rear alley looks a little tires, the apartment and deck is quite private and you feel tucked away amongst the red brick and ivy. We enjoyed several meals on the deck. The book store Carol & Carols is one of the best used book stores I have been to. A real gem. We hiked gorgeous trails and came back to a huge tv, quiet, clean, private apartment! Loved our stay!!!"

Without me reaching out, Melissa did and made sure when we got back that we had a spot to park our car. If that isn't an example of dedication and great customer service, I don't know what is. I recommend booking with Melissa, you won't regret it."

The only thing we could say wasn’t our favorite was the bed seemed super hard and hurt our backs and made it hard to sleep. That though may just be personal preference.

Stayed a few nights","I really enjoyed my stay here and would come back because of:
- Great location with quick access to major roads, highways, popular Poconos attractions and the Delaware Water Gap for hiking and recreation (if you want that, this is the place to stay!)
- A designated parking spot on a lot where my car was safe
- Clean, well stocked house that looks just like the pictures.
- Everything I needed to make stovetop and oven cooked meals at home.
- The very responsive host with thorough instructions and quick to help with any questions or issues. Things to keep in mind: there is one flight of stairs to reach the apartment and as other reviews mentioned you can faintly hear noise from neighbors in the bedroom only at night (it's not constant and during day is quiet)."

They included everything that we could possibly need; iron, hair dryer, towels, shampoo/soap, dishware, and even a few snacks. This was much cheaper and nicer than the hotels in the area, and we loved that it was located downtown so we could just walk around and grab food so easily. It was easy to check into and the hosts were always quickly available to answer questions before our stay. We also loved that it was an apartment unit and we were able to have a fridge and microwave etc at our convenience, which we would not have gotten at any of the pricey hotels in the area. All in all it was the perfect stay!"

The location is so convenient as it’s close to everything you may need in town, walkable to restaurants, cafes, wineries and stores, and only a 3 minute drive to Walmart. Everyone in and around the building that the apartment was located in was super kind, friendly and always held the door for us when coming in and out. Highly recommend this stay!"

The parking space was clutch. Allen and Melissa are considerate and communicative hosts. Only caveat would be the stairs - they are daunting for someone with mobility issues. Still, an all-around wonderful experience. Thanks so much!"

He immediately responded and was willing to send someone over if I had any further issues. In addition, he checked in with me the following day to make sure everything was going well. I would like to just suggest a 2 things:
1. Posting instructions on the stove in the kitchen. I personally never knew about the induction cooktop.
2. If it snows, getting someone to shovel the property. My guest and I slipped a few times. My boyfriend shoveled a little but shouldn't have to do that on vacation.
Other than that, excellent experience at his house!"

Stayed with kids","""Luxury needs to be removed from the description. It is supposed to sleep 12 - the bunk beds in the basement are not sturdy enough to support anyone other than young children. They shook with very little effort. The weight limit should be posted. There was dish service for 8 - we used alot of paper plates. silverware was the same problem. We had one towel per person - camp-style towels i.e. bleach stained and thin. There are NOT 4 bathrooms - there are 3 bathrooms and a powder room. Game room looked good but the video game didn't work and pool table was terrible - with 1 pool cue with a tip. Couldn't wash clothes because the dryer vented into a garage filled with paint cans & firewood - kept setting off the smoke alarms. Owners solution was to have us remove the smoke alarms & trust him. Final day - sink backed up and we couldn't run the dishwasher.
We were promised a $300.00 refund from the owner - nothing yet. Airbnb was non-responsive & unconcerned
Check-in was a disaster"

My only concerns was the master bedrooms bathroom, while I tried to shower, the door was stuck and it seemed like the more I tried to push it open, the shower was dislocating itself! I was too afraid to break anything so I had to squeeze in and out as best as I can without trying to force it open! I would’ve showered in other bathrooms but they were occupied each time it was shower time! And the hot tub took way too long to fill up! Otherwise the house was great! I expected to see bugs!

Stayed with kids","We had a lovely stay. Ester and Alon were very responsive, answering emails and texts immediately and when we ran out of propane for the grill, they sent someone over within 15 minutes to replace the tank. The unit was nicely furnished and the highlight was the screened-in sunroom where we spent much our time hanging out. The mattresses weren't super comfy and though there was no central AC, there were individual units in each room that worked well but were somewhat noisy. One of the bedrooms was lofted over the common area and, though very pretty, it had a cut out above the door so there was no sound barrier between the bedroom and the common area. I'm a light sleeper and we had a baby with us, so that bedroom was definitely not for me. But overall, we had a really nice time."

Group trip","The stay was great! I had my two teenage kids, and two of their friends with me. They loved the luxe vibe and pool table and hot tub. I was able to relax, write some music and go for epic bike rides on quiet mountain roads. Incredibly cozy and the pictures are very accurate. The place is really nice. I would definitely rent this place again, and maybe not bring not bring the kids!"

Stayed with kids","Alon and Ester were incredibly gracious and responsive hosts. Before the day of our arrival, we had communicated with Ester that, because of infant nap schedules and work, we might need to check into the house earlier than the usual check-in time as well as check-out a bit later than the usual check-out time. Ester was able to work with us within reasonable parameters to help accommodate our family's needs on that front.
Upon our arrival at the house, we found a couple of hiccups (a blown circuit and a door that needed repair), and within 20-30 minutes, someone was at the house to resolve these issues. The rest of our stay was peaceful and enjoyable. The house is tastefully decorated, spacious, comfortable, and filled with light. Everyone, from little ones to the not-so-little ones had a great time."

Stayed a few nights","We arrived at 10 PM to a house that had not been cleaned and indeed was a disaster. It looked like the previous guests had held a party in the house:
- Glitter everywhere
- Balloons all over the floor that were randomly popping
- Partially empty takeout cartons and beverages on the kitchen counters-
- Full trash bags in the kitchen just sitting on the floor
- Unmade beds with no replacement sheets
…and the entire house smelled like used women’s hygiene products. The host was responsive but kept writing “omg” which was grating and felt insincere. His offer of half off our first night, and asking us to wait around for the cleaner to come was an insult. So, we had to find a hotel at 11 PM. We had brought food with us to cook and had to store it in a hotel mini-fridge which barely fit.
Very unpleasant experience 0/10 do not recommend."

The temperature in the house is also a bit inconsistent - so very cold or too hot. The electric fireplace didn't work either unfortunately.

Stayed a few nights","The home was quaint, charming and felt like home. It reminded me of my home when I was a child and lived in Trenton. We only stayed at the home for two days. If we ever plan to vacation in the area again we would definitely stay at this home again. There was no washer or dryer but since we only stayed for 2 days we didn't need to wash anything. The driveway was a little tight for a large SUV. I had to let my husband out of the car first in order to park in the driveway. Overall there were adequate supplies for cooking.Dish soap and a sponge was provided for the kitchen dishes. Handsoap in the bathroom and a bar of soap in the tub. I did bring bath towels and wash clothes. There were a few towels supplied but we used our own towels from home. Both beds were comfortable and the duvets were warm and cozy! We enjoyed no clutter around the house and loved the pin pad to access the house. Cute, cute, cute!"

They DID NOT disappoint! The plumbing drains slowly so you may want to bring cleaning products to avoid standing in soap scum. No frills, just convenient. Nice to see the deer in the backyard like at home. Place could use a new paint job and dusting in the bathroom, but was staged very well. I would stay again, but not for an anniversary."

Convenient location. The place was clean and smelled clean, however the area rugs seemed like they had pet hair on them even though the airbnb doesn’t allow pets. Maybe it was dust or maybe the area rugs are shedding not 100% sure. It was very cozy, the heat worked very well! If you get too hot and turning it down doesn’t help, there are 2 fans in the Airbnb. Me and my fiancé had to keep the place warm for the little one and we used the fan when we slept. Overall I would stay here again! It was perfect for the Thanksgiving Holiday and visiting family!"

- Bathroom towels are very small
- There is a coffee machine, but you need to bring your own coffee
- No toiletries provided (some Air BnBs do, some don’t)
- The host does not send the house code until is is requested. We messaged 30 minutes prior to arriving and received it immediately"

The place was generally clean, but we noticed that the area rugs desperately needed to be vacuumed. We were concerned about the driveway as noted in other reviews but were able to fit two small SUVs without a problem. Similar to other reviews, we also noticed that the bath towels provided are very small, so you may want to bring your own. Instead of the access code being provided in the app before check-in, we had to message the host for the code. It was provided in a reasonable time frame and not a huge deal, but it would be nice if it was provided ahead of time like all of the other places we've stayed."

Stayed one night","At first I was really excited for my stay, & it seemed like a nice place but when I got in there was no electricity or heat & it was freezing. Orain did not respond about there being no electricity or heat for at least 4 hours, we left to go to a concert & when we came back at 1am the lights came back on but the heat still had not. So it was freezing our whole night stay, thankfully we only stayed that night. I barely slept that night because it was so cold & it really did suck because I am epileptic & I have been recovering from having lots of seizures recently, so sleep is important in general as an epileptic but especially after seizures. I paid $323 for a 1 night stay & tried to get a reasonable refund for my issues, like 50%, but all the host would give me was $60 & they told me to take it up with Airbnb support cause they won't refund me anymore than that. Which I find unprofessional & I think shows that they are an inadequate ""business owner""/host personally, I would never do business that way. Someone who properly runs their business would make enough money they have money put to the side to cover unforseen expenses like these.
Orain can respond to my review with whatever excuses they would like to try to make me look like I am in the wrong or I am exaggerating but I am not. Heat & electricity are a necessity & isn't a wild thing to want a reasonable refund for."

Stayed one night","Orain's place was okay for our short overnight trip. The house was pretty clean and the bed was comfortable. Orain was gracious enough to allow us to check in early, but there was an error in sending us the code (usually, renters receive it the day prior or morning of), and we had to stand out in the heat for a bit to wait. There was a portable AC unit in the living/dining/kitchen area which kept things cool out there, but there was a very loud window unit in the queen bedroom and only a fan in the other bedroom. We were thankful it was just the two of us. While there was a sizeable backyard, the back door of the home was not accessible, so you would have to walk around from the front to get out there. It would have been great to have some directions in the home, too. I did receive some information on the Airbnb account, but my husband couldn't get the TV to work while I was sleeping or find the WIFI password."

Stayed a few nights","The place is cute and worked for our time there (weekend). Kitchen is stocked with the very bare minimum. If you are looking to cook, bring items to store leftovers. Communication was sub par. We were left with no toilet paper, windows that were left wide open upon arrival/did not lock. Not my best Air BNB experience overall. Driveway just fit one sedan & truck."

Group trip","This was a beautiful home. It was clean and looked even better than the pictures! Very close to Shawnee Mountain. However, we said we were having 5 people stay and there were only 3 towels to shower with. The posting also said that 2 cars can fit in the driveway. But upon arrival we were informed that work was being done to the driveway and couldn’t use the whole driveway. We had two trucks, so this made it difficult to park. Overall, a positive experience."

Stayed a few nights","Orain, the host, was fine, but it wasn't the best experience I've had with Airbnb. We didn't receive an entry code prior to check in, and we weren't provided one on the app when we officially checked in. So we had to message Orain and wait for a reply before we could get into the Airbnb. The reply didn't take very long, but I wish the process had been a bit smoother. The wifi password as displayed on the listing all does not work, because it contains a few spaces before and after the password itself. We had to message the host about this and they provided the correct password, but this is something I thought they would've realized and fixed by now (because I assume other guests have had this problem)."

Stayed a few nights","Overall, it’s an excellent place to stay!! It was perfect for my friend and I for our weekend getaway. There is a cozy fireplace, a full kitchen (with a lot of extras like mugs, pots/pans, etc etc), and it had a great location! It was very clean and we had a very relaxing stay!
Some things to note:
- The parking spot is very small and you can most likely fit 1 car. Luckily we were traveling in one car, so it wasn’t an issue.
- The beds are very firm. I prefer a softer bed, but it all comes down to preference!
- The bath tub works fine as a shower, but we couldn’t get it to make a bath"

I would happily stay again if I return to the area!"

Stayed a few nights",This is a cute little house on a quiet street. You are close to I80 so easy in and out. We were there for a wedding at Turtle Lake in November. There is baseboard heat so it took a little while for the house to warm up but it does have a thermostat and and a gas fireplace that added some instant heat. The house is nicely updated and the bedrooms have nice closets. The mattresses are very firm so if you are looking for a soft bed you may reconsider. We grabbed the extra blanket from the living room for some extra warmth that first night. The house was very clean and nicely appointed. The lock system for the front door was very easy to use and the WIFI was great.

Stayed with kids","Nice hardware throughout the residence. Towels and pillows could be easily upgraded. Slightly strange smell coming from kitchen sink, reminded me of the smell from my mom’s crawlspace. I did arrive in the middle of a rainstorm so maybe that had something to do with it. You definitely smelled something when you walked in to the residence, though I quickly got used to it.
Driveway was problematic to get in and out of on both sides, on the house side, there was a plant that needed to be trimmed back and it kept getting stuck in our car door, on the far side of the driveway, its right up against big trees and you can’t open your car doors to get out. There also isn’t street parking out front so that’s not an option.
Note, if you are sleeping in the front bedroom and its windy out, you may want to put in some earplugs as the neighbors have wind chimes that aren’t that far from you. I wish the curtains blocked more light.
I would suggest the owner get some seating for the front porch, that could be a really lovely addition to this property.
Owner was kind enough to let me check in early. I would stay here again if I was in the area."

Stayed a few nights","Orain's place is a compact house, most suitable for up to four people. It is clean, and on a quiet, residential, street. The house is adequately furnished, and the kitchen and bath are both in good shape. Though one or two earlier reviews suggested otherwise, there were in fact sufficient towels provided, and appropriate supplies. The parking situation is a shade problematic. Orain's driveway is quite narrow, making it a little difficult to exit or enter parked vehicles. Moreover, two smallish vehicles could be made to fit, but two SUVs would likely not. This is not a luxurious house, but worked just fine for us for a weekend stay."

Stayed a few nights","Check-in was miserable. Confirmed earlier in the day the house would be ready for check-in at 4pm as it stated, he responded with yes. I messaged when we were 10 minutes out to ask for code to enter home. he never responded. I called multiple times and even messaged him. NO RESPONSE. after being in the car for 6 hours we decided to drive around a little more because we didn't want to just show up to this house and not have entry. After 20 minutes with no response we finally decided to just go and hope someone was there to maybe let us in. NOPE and still no reply. After 40 minutes of sitting on the porch hoping he'd see us through his security cameras, I decided to call Air bnb help center and was on the phone with them for 10 minutes and was told they would try to get ahold of host. I had to wait until 5pm until I could get a refund and hope to find another place to stay. At 4:59 (convenient) he responded with a code to enter the house and offered no apology or anything for making us wait."

Our only complaint (NOT Orain's fault) is the neighbors were having a party and blasting the music until around midnight. Keep in mind this is in a neighborhood and not a secluded location. But we are used to that from living in a city! Other than that, great location for nearby hiking, downtown Stroudsburg and walkable to East Stroudsburg main drag."

Stayed one night","Orain’s place is about the same you see in pictures. Two good enough size bedrooms and open kitchen-living room area. And it was pretty clean. We talked prior our visit and accorded that it was okay for us to get there earlier than check in time to drop off our stuff (we were going to a vineyard) but when we got there, they have not cleaned the place yet so we had to wait 4 hours, which for the size of the place, i thought it was a little much. It’s not a big deal but we would have rather to plan ahead for this. Other thing we were disappointed about is that the fireplace is not actually a fireplace and it was not even working. Someone came and tried to fix it but it just didn’t work, this was one of the main things we were looking forward too and it was a shame we did not get to enjoy it. The area is not the greatest but it was pretty quiet all night.
Overall is a good stay if you need to do something around the area."

Stayed with kids","We had a fantastic time at Javier and Mariela's home! It is a beautiful, serene, and cheerful home; our daughters (3 and 7) loved the playhouses, toys, stuffies, and books, and the snacks that they left us! The backyard is even nicer than the pictures; at night, with the lights turned on, it was magical. The whole house was really charming. We saw several deer, including a fawn, that came very close to the deck. The community was perfect, with a swimming pool (which alas we were not able to take advantage of), a playground, and a lake all within a few blocks. We biked and walked to these, but it was steep for the 7-year-old. (and maybe for me, I could be in better shape!)
A few things to note:
-Our GPS claimed their house was a few houses sooner than it was, so make sure that the house numbers are right
-Plenty of towels, throw blankets etc, but if you go to the beach/pool, they request that you bring your own.
-The beds are on the firm side"

Stayed a few nights","My friends and I had the pleasure of staying at Javier and Mariela's wonderfully-accommodating home in the woods of the Penn Estates community over Memorial Day weekend. Registration of our vehicles at the gatehouse was easy, and the house was a short drive from the gate. We used the house as a base for exploring the scenic wonders of the Delaware Water Gap region; its proximity to good hiking and waterfalls was ideal. It had everything we needed and much more besides. We thoroughly enjoyed relaxing in the hot tub and by the fire pit, cooking in the spacious kitchen and grilling/dining on the beautifully-lit deck. Our host provided a binder with clear directions for using the amenities (only lighting the grill needed some clarification), and Javier was kind and quick to respond to any questions we had. The property was clean and nicely updated, with cozy, air-conditioned bedrooms, a cathedral-ceilinged living room and a lounge loft on the second floor. We hope to stay here again!"

We didn't venture outside of the airbnb, as we were looking for a home away from home. This place served its purpose. We spent our day lounging out in front of the TV and enjoying nature. One morning we were greeted by friendly deer and my daughter loved that! We had breakfast on the patio and later enjoyed the hot tub. The outdoor fireplace came in handy for the late night smores. We had difficulties with the fireplace but I contacted our host Javier and he was conveniently in the area and available to help! He came by and got us situated with the fireplace which we appreciated. We also had a few other hiccups, but he took care of those issues right away! The home was clean and had all the things we needed to ensure a comfortable stay. We would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend their home. The hosts were great! Thank you."

The quiet and serene neighborhood, surrounded by nature and wildlife, was a refreshing break from the hustle and bustle of city life.
Overall, we highly recommend this cozy and charming retreat for anyone looking to escape and unwind in a tranquil natural setting. Javier and Mariela's attention to detail, hospitality, and beautiful property make this a must-visit destination. We can't wait to come back!"

Stayed with kids","Javier and Mariela were such courteous and responsive hosts. They were always really quick to get back to me when I had a question, and were also very accommodating in allowing me to check in an hour early. Their home was beautiful, like the photos, but even better in person. Lots of charm and personal touches, and perfect for little children. There was a children's bedroom with a lot of toys for our son to play with, and a tree house in the backyard that he couldn't get enough of. We were about 20 min away from both Camelback and Shawnee resorts, and a little over 10 min away from the downtown area of Stroudsburg which has many great stores and restaurants. The area was very quiet and peaceful and allowed for a good night's sleep. I definitely recommend staying here, and would love to bring my family back."

There were snacks and coffee provided, toys, books, and kitchen utensils for small children as well as books, music and cable for adult entertainment. They provided soap, shampoo and conditioner and plenty of towels. Most importantly, when there was a power outage (due to the weather) the hosts were very responsive and accommodating. I will definitely be returning soon as we found some local attractions we're very interested in. This was a great experience that my family will always remember."

They went above and beyond with all of the little details even down to a very thorough welcome binder with QR codes to help locate local spots to visit. The vibes were just right and the pellet fireplace gave just the right feel for a chilly winter night! We were able to relax and enjoy a quiet weekend away in their gorgeous home. Cozy house is a very appropriate name for their home!

Stayed with kids","This house was well stocked with everything we could have needed from the fruit and chilled water that was ready upon our arrival to linens, toys, and throw blankets to snuggle up by the fire. The place was super clean and Javier communicated very well with us throughout the process. The backyard fairytale cottage was perfect for our two girls and we enjoyed playing tennis and basketball at the community playground. A great weekend getaway!
A few points of feedback for those doing some serious BnB sluething to find the ""perfect"" spot.
- While the community was very secure we did find the neighbors to be a bit close. The photos made it seem a bit more secluded.
- Very cozy and nice but you can hear everything. When the kids were up at 6:20, so were you.
- There are no sidewalks. Not an huge issue but we didn't want the kids walking to the playground alone (9yos) without a sidewalk."

The kids (4 and 2) were delighted by the treehouse, the play closet full of costumes, toys, and books, and the cozy loft space beautifully equipped for movies on a rainy day. The house was spotless and well-stocked for all of our needs, and the deer and cats that roam the properties were an added bit of magic to a relaxing time away. We were a short 10-15 minute drive from restaurants, parks, and other fun activities. We would come back in a heartbeat!"

Stayed with kids","I brought my kids (age 9 and 12) to Javier's house for a long weekend, which ended up not being long enough to enjoy everything about the house and surrounding area. We've decided we'll just have to return sometime! The house is spacious, spotlessly clean, beautifully decorated, and very comfortable. Plus, there's a ton of stuff there for younger kids to enjoy: the outdoor fairy house, an indoor playhouse, and lots of accessories to go with them. My kids are on the older side, but they were still thrilled with the house and said they were ""enchanted"". The hosts are very helpful and responsive, even sending me a video of how to use the nespresso machine since I am coffee-technology-impaired (there's also a keurig and a simple filter contraption for making coffee). And the house is only about a 10 minute drive to the charming downtown area of Stroudsburg, and about 30 minutes from Bushkill Falls which was amazing. My only complaint is something outside of the host's control, which is that getting through the front gate took a long time (15-20 minutes?) our first two times through, while all of the out-of-towners (including us) were getting their passes. So be prepared to wait a bit at the end of your drive. But we decided it was well worth it. Also, if you have any white noise machines, you might want to bring them along because sound travels in the large house. (Not a diss, just a suggestion; we forgot ours but we did OK.) Overall, highly recommend!"

Stayed with kids","I have to give a 5 star review on Javier and Mariela's cozy fairytale home. it was absolutely perfect for our family with 2 young girls, 4 and 2. the home was perfectly stocked and had a little welcome package when we arrived. the deer that show up at the front door must be trained to do so lol. what a perfect touch! we foundwe were positioned close enough to restaurants/coffee shops and some shopping us all the great waterfalls north towards Raymondskill Falls down to Bushkill and some other hidden gems in between. We think it would be great for a small family or couple. beautiful home and lots of little extras, toys for the kids. Really inviting space and absolutely spotless. Just as advertised. We stayed at Hotel Hershey the night prior and kind of wish we'd just taken an extra day here it was so nice. Thanks to Javier for being in easy contact but not pressing us either"

Allowing our furry pooch to travel with us made it extra special and though we were not there for the summer season to enjoy some of the other community amenities, we are pretty confident we will be back with the rest of our family. Seeing the deer was a nice treat as well along with access to the gated dog park. Thank you again Javier and Mariela for allowing us to stay in your home and making us feel welcome. Tony and Ally"

Stayed with kids","This home was wonderful!! It was a recommendation from a friend and I’m so happy I listened to her. The home was clean and toddler friendly- which is a big deal for us. They even had an extra potty so we didn’t have to lug ours up and down the stairs. Our son loved all the toys and BOTH playhouses. The only downside the home had was a personal one - we found the queen beds too firm for our liking and I’m only adding this in if you have a back that requires something softer. The twin beds however are sooo comfortable! The community is amazing as well. We fed deer, played with fish in the lake, and spent a day hanging out in the pools. The community center also has really good food! Also good to note, the home is really close to Camelback/Aquatopia- something that really came in handy with a few days of not so great weather. Javier & Maria were amazing hosts and stayed in constant contact. We will definitely be back!"

As soon as we entered, we noticed how clean everything was, and there was a lot of natural light coming through the large windows and skylight. There were a bunch of toys in the closet as well as everything a family with kids would need (I.e. a pack n’ play, booster seat and high chair). Our toddler loved playing on the Radio Flyer tricycle, and the older kids spent a lot of time in the adorable fairytale tree house. The outside deck was large and comfortable as well. My in-laws enjoyed walking to the lake and pool with the baby while the rest of us went to the local theme parks (which were all within 20 minutes driving distance). I would highly recommend this home to anyone looking to have a great family vacation in the Poconos!"

Stayed a few nights","Javier and Mariela are amazing hosts! They clearly answered all of my questions before booking so quickly and were very accommodating. The house is beautiful on the inside and outside. It was exactly what we wanted a weekend away in the mountains with beautiful trees surrounding you, fall foliage, and deers! Really felt like a cozy warm cabin in the woods with the fireplace and feel of the place. We looked forward to cozy nights by the fire and comfortable couch. Another added bonus, it was the most kid friendly air bnb we have stayed out. A kids room with a kids table, tons of toys, books, potties, pack n play crib. They also have a little house in the kids bedroom which my daughter loved to play in and they also have a treehouse in the backyard with a kids kitchen! Will definitely stay here again. Thank you Javier and Mariela!"

Stayed a few nights","TRUTH PREVAILED! So here’s the deal. The Mrs. and I do deep searches when we travel. It’s worth it to us. We narrowed our Poconos options to 5 and settled on Javier and Mariela’s place. Best move we made. [Side note, we went by the other 4 houses and they were annoyingly and frustratingly misleading. Many properties here are.]
Here’s why this got 5 stars from us:
1.) Truthfully advertised. It’s what is says and more. The house is cozy, inviting and this sounds corny but it just feels happy. After hiking all day it was a wonderful home to return to.
2. It’s got all the amenities you need. We cooked-in several meals and needed for nothing (but I had my own spice kit so that helped).
3.) Location. Oh the location. PERFECT for us. As far as home bases go, this was it. 15-20 minutes to one of the better towns in the Poconos (Stroudsburg and East Stroudsburg), 50 minutes to Jim Thorpe (worth a visit once), 1 hr to Honesdale (cool little town for sure), 20 minutes to Camelback. It was all we needed. Plus the house is in a private community and specifically in what feels like a fun neighborhood. The neighbors decorate for Halloween, smile when you drive pass, etc. And oh the deer. All day every day around the house. It’s amazing.
4.) Javier + Mariela. Couldn’t be any nicer or more accommodating. Response time is about 30 seconds. They’re just great.
Thanks for having us. We would love to return.
Danny + Kim"

Stayed with kids","Amazing place to stay if you are in the area. Very quite and safe community with a beautiful lake and creeks! Owners communication is top notch and they were very prompt to respond when ever we pined them. House is amazingly clean. Onset shared a detailed instruction which helped. Kitchen was stocked with all required stuff needed for cooking. K-cup Coffee collection is nice. We cooked meals and enjoyed it outside a cute porch overlooking cute little tree house and woods. We felt very safe with our 5 years and 1 year little ones. Beds were very comfy and house was spacious for our group (4 adults and 2 kids). Welcome hamper was extremely nice touch by the owners. If you are in area and looking for stay in a nice, safe community, please do yourself a favor and book this nice cozy and comfy house. We did and we have no regrets :)
Thank you so much Javier for allowing us rent your place."

Our girls had the time of their lives playing in the tree-house, swimming in the community pool and enjoying the wildlife. (We saw a fox, hawks and a lot of deer).

The pool and lake within the complex are well taken care of and were not super crowded. The location is within about 20 minutes from a lot of great attractions including Camelbeach, Tannersville Outlets, and Bushkill Falls. We found a great trail along the river to bike and run on just 8 minutes from the house as well (PineBrooke Park). We stayed for a week with our 5 and 8 year-olds and had a great time! A special thank you to the hosts for graciously mailing a forgotten item to us. Again, I cannot say enough positive things about this rental!"

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed a long weekend stay at Javier and Mariela's house. The house and amenities are accurately described in the listing and most reviews. The house was warm and cozy with plenty of space for up to 6, although the room with two twins is best suited for kids since it's a little smaller and the indoor playhouse is in that room. There was a lot of snow on the ground (February), but the driveway was very well cleared.
Javier communicated very well ahead of time and when we had one question. He provides detailed instructions for getting a temporary pass for your car. The security people are a little brusque, but we didn't have any problems getting the pass or getting in and out easily.
We would stay here again."

My kids loved sledding, playing in the playhouses, and watching the deer. Note: the downstairs bed is pretty firm, but the beds upstairs were more comfortable. We would definitely stay again!"

Stayed with kids","This is a bit of a mixed review because while the house was as described/depicted, the hosts were generous in leaving a welcome basket of Prosecco and snacks, and Javier was very quick to respond to me whenever I messaged through the app, we also experienced a pretty major problem with toilets not working during our stay. We noticed a bit of a problem as soon as we arrived, but by the next day we had one toilet not working at all. When I messaged Javier to report the problem, he replied right away, but we were also right in the middle of a three-day snowstorm. As such, a plumber couldn’t come and even though Javier offered to look himself, the roads weren’t plowed so we told him to stay home and we’d try to make it work. He suggested pouring hot water in the toilets and this did get them usable on a temporary basis. We tried to muddle through that way for a few days, in part because we were nervous about having someone outside our pod in the house during COVID, but eventually requested a plumber. We messaged Javier fairly late at night, he replied right away, and had a plumber there by noon the next day. I write this full description to say that Javier did the best he could as a host in this situation, but it’s also not a five star experience if you’re constantly worrying about whether toilets will work. Hopefully it’s one of those things that was a fluke and is resolved. One other small thing to report is that the coffee pot needs to be replaced— it is taped and has a crack in the glass. I’m guessing this just hasn’t been reported to the hosts.
I can say that our three year old absolutely adored the house and didn’t want to leave. As many reviewers have said, it is a wonderful place for small children with a fun kids bedroom, toys, books, outdoor playhouse, and lots of other things you might need— gate for the stairs, high chair, etc. In general, the space was large and comfortable. Lots of natural light and deer roaming in the yard (again, delightful for our child). I stayed in the queen bedroom upstairs and I wish there was a bedside table on the right side of the bed— it’s kind of a bummer to feel around for my glasses on the floor in the darkness.
I was very happy that the hosts had left a shovel and ice melt out, since we stayed during a heavy snowstorm. My husband thought the hosts should have offered to shovel/plow the driveway, but I sincerely wanted the outdoor time and exercise so I didn’t mind shoveling and didn’t ask for any help from the hosts. If you’re traveling during snow and this would be a concern to you, I’d assume the hosts would work with you because they seem very nice."

Our toddler loved all the toys and playhouses, as well sitting in front of the fireplace while it snowed outside at night. Mariela was quick to respond to all of our questions and accommodating to our needs. She didn’t even get upset when our son broke one of the lamps. The house probably needs a little updating in the kitchen and bathrooms and there isn’t too much to do in close proximity (especially right now) but it’s the perfect place for some quiet, family time in a cozy and comfortable space. You can tell the hosts truly care about the house and their guests. Thank you Mariela and Javier!"

In addition to all of this, the house was very kid-friendly and had a crib, safety gates, baby bath, bassinet, and loads of toys, plus TWO playhouses- one inside the children’s bedroom and one outside in a tree. Our two year-old absolutely loved staying here and was so excited to play in this new environment each day, and all of the amenities made traveling with our four month-old very easy.
They made check-in very easy, and the community they love in seems safe and secure. It also has two playgrounds, which was great even in the cold weather. There are tons of deer around, which my son loved spotting!
Most of all, Javier & Mariela are very responsive and quick to address any questions and concerns you may have. I can not recommend this property enough. It’s no wonder they are considered Superhosts!"

Must pay extra for early check in and late check out.
Only thing that was less than ideal is that late check out was not granted to us until an hour before normal check out, despite the fact that my request for late check out was well in advance (days ahead). On morning of check out, received a reminder to check out by 11, and then afterwards, a message stating that late check out is granted. By then we had already made alternative plans. Wish the communication on this point was better.
But other than that, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"

This place looks exactly like the pictures and there’s more to see when you actually check in! It was so clean and I absolutely love the aesthetic. There’s a beautiful river that my partner and I sat by and had a mini picnic! Surrounding area also has a bunch of restaurants (mostly pubs) which great food. My favorite was the “farmhouse”! The only thing I will say is the pinpad to the room was hard to get a first but all you need is a little push!
Anyways, If you’re looking for somewhere nice to stay definitely make this the top of your list. Not to mention the hosts were amazing and very responsive! I definitely will be booking here again"

- Hosts very responsive and helpful.
- A lot of TV options.
- Easy lock box check-in
Neg
- Advertised second bathroom however was out of order. My mom had to enter our bedroom to use the Master bath. Not a huge deal.
- Few clean towels; weren’t enough wash cloths for all of us."

The master bedroom bed was (super comfy). We even asked the host if they can send us the info on the mattress.
Great area with plenty of things to do. We definitely will be back! Thank you!!!"

All of our clothes, shoes, snow gear, and suitcases fit with extra room. The bathrooms were the cleanest out of any air bnb I’ve stayed. The kitchen is spacious and stocked. It was nice being able to cook meals rather then go out to eat. The beds were extra comfy…. We are actually looking to buy one for home now! Our host responded to all questions fast. Grocery store and Walmart are literally across the street. Plenty of restaurants and pubs in the area for eating too. Washer and dryer on premise was great after a day on the slopes."

Stayed a few nights","The apartment is very clean and spacious. If you ever want to cook they have every cooking appliances available and there is a nice laundry room. Entire apartment has high ceilings and there are only two windows in the entire apartment so you barely get any sunlight. However, you have to do your own dishes and put the towels in the washers even though you are paying for cleaning fees. The apartment has quiet hours and somewhat sound proof, I was able to hear the next door neighbors conversation, maybe they were too loud but sounded pretty clear. They have Netflix available for you and there are TVS in the bedroom and living room area. Walmart is within walking distance and restaurants are very close. Overall I would give this apartment five stars and communication with the host was very easy and fast."

Stayed with kids",I was very happy with this apartment. I will say I could have saved time if I had read the check in instructions. I went to the wrong door so it was a slightly longer walk. However the instructions are amazing and have all the info. The place is close to everything. Giant is literally Around the corner. It took about 14 minutes to get to Shawnee. I will stay again.

Stayed with kids","I am sorry, but I need to give a 3-star rating for this place for the following reasons:
1. Getting into this place is a lot more complicated than expected.
2. The place looks much smaller than it appears in the pictures.
3. Most importantly, when I booked this place, we planned to cancel it within another 15 minutes, but the cancellation policy was so weird that it only offered a 40% refund of the original payment.
4. ⁠We booked this place specifically to have a BBQ, and when we arrived, the police told us that outdoor BBQ is not allowed, which was very disappointing, and the owners didn't notify us about this beforehand."

I was a little upset about the fire pit being full of water and not being able to find wood. There was also a noise in the house which we at first thought was the ice maker but then couldn’t find out where it was coming from and kept some of us up at night. But over all house was comfortable and nice for our weekend trip."

There were plenty of activities to do in the house (pool table, ping pong, grill, fireplace) and in the community (basketball/sports). I would definitely stay at this Airbnb again."

There was enough bed space to host 8 guest comfortably. The neighbor hood was beautiful, quite, and safe. I felt like I was home away from home. I definitely would book Ey's place again and I recommend this location to anyone. It Gets ***** (STARS) from me !!!! Thanks Ey's for having us !!!"

Stayed with kids","Ey is a great host very communicative and quick to response, my reservation was a last minute and I appreciate how soon she help me with the rental process .
The pros and cons of the house
Pro: house is very peaceful and quiet, we loved the silence and we sleep a lot
Price was ok
Bed is comfortable
Cons: gate entrance with gps take you to the back of the community and it’s a hassle to go back to the main entrance following a guide they provide you at the gate
The house looks humongous in the pictures and I got surprise with the small it is specially the patio , ( less filter)
If you like to cook and grill don’t expect any condiments in the house not even salt, not even sugar for the coffee ☕️, make sure you bring all your seasoning condiment ( I do understand some hostess do it as complimentary)
The patio was dirty and grill so I clean but I do understand it was a last minute reservation so no house cleaning was able to do it before
Also there is only one TV for the whole house"

Stayed with kids","Ey provided clear instructions once we booked our stay in order to have a smooth check-in. The place is as pictured, and we had enough seats and beds for 5 adults and 3 children. The towels were limited and on the smaller size, so I would recommend bringing a few extra, especially if you plan on using the pool. There was hotel-sized body soap so it can feel limiting if you are a large group staying. Wish we had some of the basics for cooking beyond salt and pepper such as additional seasoning and cooking oil. There were 3 pods of coffee, but luckily we had brought our own. Overall, I definitely recommend this place for a family getaway. We enjoyed the sauna, game room, balcony, hammocks and deck for outdoor grilling."

Group trip","The strict and overbearing rules of the gated community that this house is located in prevented us from fully enjoying our stay. They required way too much information from the guest including. licensee plate numbers , year make model and color of the vehicles as well as first and last name of all guests and if they were under 21 years old. It was as if we were staying at the White House. We ordered a pizza to the house they wouldn’t even allow a delivery driver in the community we had to drive all the way to the gate to get our food. We also had a driver come to pick us up for dinner and they would not allow him in unless I provided his plate number and name to security and when I did this they said the name had to be given from the home owner so instead of enjoying my trip I had to make about 15 phone calls trying to relay basic information and we wound up once again just having to drive to the security gate to get picked up. The house itself was very nice and clean."

Group trip","The place was clean and in a very nice gated community. Ey was excellent to communicate with. The only real downside was gaining entry into the gated community. When we first got there (the GPS took us to the back gate), the gate was closed to anyone who was checking in for the first time. So, we ended up having to figure out how to get to the Welcome Center which was a bit of a drive to get to the other entrance. Once there, it was relatively easy to get in with an ID. It was also a huge hassle to get into the community via an Uber which was a problem for all involved after we went on a Trolley tour of local wineries for the day. So, make sure you go to the front gate, and if you plan on getting an Uber, make sure they are able to get access to the community first.
That being said, again, Ey was great and the place itself was very nice and well maintained."

Stayed with kids","Check in was easy and place was just like the pictures. Pictures seem a bit bigger but wasn’t that big. It was just right for a group of 10ppl. Place seem renovated which was nice. Now, place did have a bit of a dust but I feel that it was from the renovation. Stairs to the upstairs floor was a little dirty.
Kitchen didn’t have spices nor brooms to clean crumbs from the little mess we made in the morning with kids. Not, enough towels or no towels in the rooms for guests. And there was this annoying sound coming from the outside by the downstairs bedroom which never went off. I’m assuming it was from the heater. It was a bit annoying but I got use to it. Also, no tvs in the rooms which I didn’t mind at all.
Overall, the place is great with games for the kids and adults. Loved that the top rooms had access to the outside (meaning sliding doors to outside). Loved the fire place. Pool table was a great entertainment for the adults. We definitely loved the place and you get to see deers"

The other thing was the code for the door didn’t seem to work properly when I returned a second time to the property at 1am ( which was a little scary since it was dark on the main road). I had to enter it multiple times to enter the home, lastly the bedroom ceiling fan was extremely loud. It actually woke me out of my sleep.
Other then that the location was great and the unit was perfect for one person.
I communicated one time with the owner and he was responsive in a very timely manner and informative of the area."

Stayed a few nights","We want to bring to your attention a few things we encountered at the J spot. The apartment was noted to be very clean with very strong air fresheners. It was quaintly cozy, however it wouldn’t be my first choice with the list of concerns
- [ ] porch light inoperable. Very dark outside and unable to determine which location as the address is the same on each apartment door
- [ ] Kitchen table chair seat unsecured
- [ ] Front porch railing loose-potential fall hazard
- [ ] Bathroom power socket inoperative
- [ ] Bedroom fan very very noisy
- [ ] Bed sheets would not stay in place
- [ ] Toilet is positioned In a small cornered space where you can’t sit squarely, you have to sit to the side of the toilet.
- [ ] Front window curtains facing busy road do not allow privacy- unable to close
I asked for a cancellation for the remaining 2 nights after our first night of initial expressed concerns without any accommodation. Further stay revealed additional concerns my spouse noted. Our stay was not comfortable as the stated issues were quite a nuisance."

This was our first time staying at an air Bnb and it was such a nice/relaxing experience. Easy check in and the house was clean and cozy. Only 8 minutes away from Walmart and 25 minutes to kalahari. 2 adults and 1 toddler and it was just enough space.

Listing makes it seem like this is stand alone but it is In a house with very this walls, neighbors alarm had us up at 4Am and they didn’t shut it off for several minutes. Dishwasher was full when we arrived, luckily we didn’t need the kitchen. There was a broken chair on the porch that could of been picked up to make it a little cleaner. Overall a decent place"

Stayed a few nights","The place is in a very convenient location to the ski mountains around town. Was about a 30 minute drive to Jack Frost and is about the same to Camelback.
It's a one bedroom place and is slightly cramped but for a couple or a small group it's not too bad.
A couple things to know ahead of time: You can hear the neighbors through the bedroom wall and on the second floor above you very well and we had to deal with that at 2, 3, and 4am across our stay. The toilet in the bathroom is very cramped and you can't sit directly on it. Lastly, the place is right off of a busy road so if you're used to city noise it will be fine but if you're not it might be hard to sleep at night. The cars are pretty loud going past.
Overall it's a nice place and is a good value for what you get."

Eventually the dog settled down and everything was okay. Only the front yard (near the main road) can be used so don’t expect a quiet “pocono getaway” however the pizza place across the streets (toninos) was huge portions and pretty darn good! Location is great to be in the middle of things, not so great for a quiet getaway. Road and upstairs neighbors are pretty noisy for timid dogs, not a “quiet woodsy getaway”. Everything was clean though which i appreciated."

Stayed a few nights","The J spot was at a prime location for camelback mountain adventures. It says it can sleep 4 but I think any more than 2 people and it would be a little crowded and uncomfortable. It was super clean with everything we needed to cook and a bunch of spices. The water dispenser had an empty water cannister on it, so we had to go out and buy one to drink filtered water. There was a very strong smell to thr place that gave both of us a headache. Its hard to say what It was was but it was a sharp smell. The bedding and bed were super comfortable and so were the couches and there were 2 nice user friendly TVs. The neighbors upstairs were very loud. One of their phones were vibrating on the floor on and off for about 30 minutes at 4 am for 5 minute intervals at a time until I started knocking on the ceiling. James was always available when we needed to chat with him and was very helpful"

Cons: Home is older than photos show, photos show mostly modern appliances and couches but home is older with windows difficult to open and close and baseboard heating. TV volume gave off static sound regardless of what program. Other house/people living upstairs that you could hear walking. Couple items were broken during first stay (freezer handle and bathroom window), handle fixed by second stay and packing tape over bathroom window but window still remained cracked."

Very clean, cute and perfect for a couple wanting to get away for a few nights. We have already talked about coming back when the weather gets warmer as we would like to do some more hiking. A great place for a great value and close to many different food places and a super market. We were very pleased, thank you!"

He made himself available through out the whole process during this holiday season. The living room had a contemporary feel to it which made the stay feel like home. Large TV’s in both bedroom and living room, equipped with satellite tv to cater to your entertainment. The kitchen was fully equipped for any type of cooking.

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at the cabin 2 nights and overall had a great experience with just a couple of issues. Let’s start with the amazing:
The location: it is a beautiful home in a peaceful little slice of nature. The river is perfection and the highlight of the trip for my husband. There’s enough houses to not feel isolated but far enough apart for privacy. Lots of exterior lighting.
Sunroom: immaculate (I could have spent the whole time in there)
Bathroom: gorgeously done, with a heater and deliciously hot water.
Misc: heaters with mounted remotes in living spaces; spices in the kitchen; fast wifi; nice neighbors
However a couple of things can use improvement:
The bed is squeaky, the pillows are flat and the mattress absolutely wrecked our backs.
The 2 sets of double windows in the front do not lock and can be pulled open from the outside. (I’m hoping this is on their list of exterior improvements)
We want to come back so hopefully they get more secure windows soon."

Stayed a few nights","Garth was extremely responsive and supremely helpful in our stay! The cabin was brand new and beautiful! The river sounds next to the house were quite nice, and the fire pit was quite relaxing at night. It was remote enough that we saw quite a few stars, and a shooting star one night too! The little town of East Stroudsburg is just a few minutes away and had everything we needed, and the surrounding hiking parks were great! Although it was a little chilly when we got to the area in the evening, the sunroom got nice and toasty warm with the sun, almost like a little greenhouse. We loved eating out on the screened in porch and enjoying the view and sounds of the river as we ate! There were a few potholes in the road as you drive in, but as long as you drive slowly and carefully you'll be fine. In addition the bathroom was very luxurious and beautiful. Loved the time out there; wish we could have stayed another night! Thanks so much Garth, we'll be back!"

The cabin was spotless, impeccable, and clean! Entering the living room, we were greeted with a welcome letter and given the instructions we needed in order to use all appliances and applications at the house. Garth and Savannah also left us a beautiful gift in which we were very thankful. We also had the pleasure of being the first guests at this cabin, and we must say it was amazing!
One of the best aspects of our trip is the fact that if we needed anything, their communication time was immediate. Any questions comments concerns we had were always answered in a quick fashion. Garth and Savannah wanted to make sure that we were taken care of properly and that we received the most enjoyment out of our weekend getaway! and we were very thankful for their attention. The River view was spectacular! The pictures we took were awesome!.Recommend 💯

It was nice to bring our baby and not have to worry about traveling with a portable crib or highchair, since these items were provided. A few things I would suggestfor Vera to add to the home just to make it more luxurious would be a wider variety of glassware, as well as more towels provided, and perhaps robes for using the sauna. We ended up doing several loads of laundry because we always needed a clean towel. But otherwise it was a great visit and we really enjoyed it."

Stayed a few nights","Tranquility and Soaking Serenity
This place was pure relaxation! The scenery surrounding the property is beautiful and calming. The best part was when we were lucky enough to have the deers grace us with their presence. Waking up to such beauty each morning was truly a gift. The home itself was incredibly inviting and cozy. It felt like a true escape into nature's embrace, with plenty of natural light and exposed wood beams and a calming fireplace crackling in the evenings. We appreciated the home decor and fell in love with the art wall that sits above the fireplace in the livingroom.
And then there was the sauna, soaking tub and hot tub! After a day of exploring the natural wonders nearby, soaking in the tub or the steamy hot tub surrounded by lush greenery was the epitome of relaxation.
If you're looking for a place to unwind, reconnect with nature, and create memories that will last a lifetime, this is it! Vera was a great host and always helpful. Don't hesitate to book a stay."

We loved making meals in the spacious kitchen and enjoyed our coffee around the fire pit in the morning. The sauna and hot-tub were amazing!! If only it were summer, we would have taken advantage of the lakes and pools in the community as well! Overall, we loved our stay and I would highly recommend this home for any time of year!"

The home is in a neighborhood, so you might have some noise coming from other homes, but only one while we were there. It is in the woods, which I love. We were centered right in the middle of the areas we wished to see and play in. Vera's instructions were by far the most thorough I have ever seen. She covered all the bases in a very complete and meticulous way. I have stayed in some Airbnb homes that had no instructions at all. That's not good. She also responded immediately with and concerns and questions."

Great amenities, house was clean and had everything we needed. Only thing to note is if traveling with babies or toddlers, the loft railings on the second floor are not safe. Our 2 year old could have fallen through them if we didn’t watch him, so just make sure you keep an eye on your little ones if they are wild and explorative :)
Would highly recommend to someone wanting a relaxing cosy trip!"

The kitchen is a joy to cook in, and the living area is comfortable, nice lighting throughout and the upstairs bathroom is stunning.
The sauna and hot tub are also really great amenities to have and they both work perfectly.
However the house is not as secluded as the photos suggest, it is surrounded closely by multiple houses in close proximity. And I also found the beds to be very firm. But other than that I enjoyed my stay at the house."

I would highly recommend this place for anyone who is looking for a relaxing getaway. The only thing about our trip that I would change is that we should’ve used the sauna more than once.
I will say that getting there proved to be a little difficult for us, being that Apple Maps took us to the south entrance of the penn estates (which is not the correct entrance for guests to check in) but Vera was very responsive as well as the security staff and they were able to get us on a path to the welcome center.
Overall, because of our fantastic experience at the house, we were thinking of rebooking this place for the sometime in the winter."

Stayed with kids","We stayed at Vera’s place for 5 nights with our two younger children. The home was decorated beautifully and had a lovely bohemian feel to it. The upstairs bath has a spa/zen tone to it allowing natural light with the skylight. The beds and linens were extremely comfortable. The kitchen had all of necessary items to cook meals and was stocked with coffee as well. We also enjoyed the outdoor amenities including screened porch, fire pit, hot tub and sauna. The house is a mile walk from the pool (has a kiddie pool) and playground which was great for us to get out on a nice walk in the mornings. The beach is a short drive and was just large enough for our two kids to enjoy the warm lake and some fishing off the dock. The one day in the community they were hosting a Disney day at the pool which our kids enjoyed as well. The highlight for the kids was the wildlife that roams the community. The house is nicely done and we would certainly recommend. More than enough space for our family of 4."

Although it was just the two of us, the home was spacious enough to accommodate other guests comfortably. There were so many amenities we could’ve just stayed in all weekend to enjoy the house! However, there is so much to do in the area. We drove to the local town for some exploring and checked out the local shops. I recommend Main Street Jukebox if you’re into music and vintage vinyls as we both are! I myself am vegan and it can be tricky finding places to eat but there were lots of options in the area! I highly recommend if you’re looking for a cozy getaway in a beautiful, private home."

Stayed with kids","House is exactly or better than advertised. Great location in a private community. Bedrooms are very clean with great beds. Backyard is very fun with a firepit and hottub. Vera was very helpful and provided very clear instructions for everything. Would love to come back next year.
FYI - about 15 minutes to Camelback and 20 to Shawnee. Made a great hub for ski weekend."

Stayed one night","An absolute amazing place to stay in the Poconos. From the kitchen to the bathrooms, the property was well designed and laid out. The backyard fire pit, sauna, and hot tub was the chef’s kiss of the trip. Host was also super friendly and helpful with a detailed guidebook. Can’t wait to come back! Thank you for hosting this place and the memories."

Stayed one night","This poconos retreat is STUNNING. It feels like you’re walking into a spread in Architectural Digest. The shared spaces are so cozy and comfortable but super elevated and design forward. The furniture is super comfortable. The king bed upstairs was very comfortable.
The hot tub, sauna, fire pit is what makes everything so much more special than just an Airbnb.
I have zero complaints and would 100% recommend."

Group trip",We had a wonderful mini getaway for New Year's Eve weekend with two other couples. The house itself was beautifully furnished and had many amenities. Plenty of hiking and fun breweries around as well. Vera and Alex were extremely responsive to any questions we had. We would gladly stay again on a future Poconos trip.

Stayed with kids","OMG beautiful home!! We absolutely loved staying here during the holidays! Vera and Alex were responsive and friendly. They provided a guide with everything you need from check in, local recommendations, etc. My children felt at home. The hot tub was VERY relaxing even in the cold weather. We can't wait to visit again! Home was spotless and spacious. The bathroom in the master bedroom was my highlight as a mother We need a hideaway ;) Absolutely recommend to stay here"

Stayed with kids","We had a fantastic stay at Vera and Alex's villa! We visited two days before Christmas and got to enjoy their cozy, beautiful home.
The house is incredible, it's beautifully designed, spotless, and very comfortable. We caught a bit of the winter storm and were greeted by some deer grazing happily in the back yard, this made my niece and nephew soo excited (and the grown ups too to be honest ;).
Vera was a wondeful host, very organized and thoughtful. Both Vera and Alex were very responsive to any needs and kind. Their virtual guidebook is super handy and helpful.
Highly recommended staying here and would be thrilled to come back when it's a bit warmer to enjoy the other amenities!"

Stayed a few nights","It was great to get away and ski for the first time in a long time. Vera's place was very convenient to get to Camelback Mountain. It's proximity to NY, NJ, PA etc. make it easy to Ski or Trout fish considering it's near The Gap. It is also centrally located to many eating spots locally ( Try Garlic, and The Cure for dinner and breakfast).
The Hot tub was a welcomed respite after a bunch of runs down the mountain. The sauna ( Hot Box) dried us off after the warm soak and made us ready for some wine and dinner.
The woodsy setting is peaceful and we enjoyed watching the deer meander through the back yard foraging for greens.
We didn't cook in while there, but it is well stocked if you care to enjoy a home-cooked meal with family and friends. There is ample room for a large family, we had 3; our fourth couldn't make it but if he did there was more than enough space for everyone's privacy."

Stayed a few nights","I have nothing but good things to say about our stay here. It was amazing! I enjoyed the style of the place and all the little intricacies like the cool light switches and the way the living room TV can extend to face the living room. You can tell they put a lot of time into designing the place and making it both functional and chic. The kitchen was so nice to use and we enjoyed cooking in it. Everything was nice and clean when we got there. We used the sauna, and I used the bathtub upstairs, and both were awesome! The instruction site provided made it very easy to understand how to use everything including the alarm. Everything needed (grocery store, coffee, restaurants) were within 10-12 minutes of the location. This place was the perfect getaway, and we had such a relaxing weekend. I would return in a heartbeat and recommend it to anyone who asked about a place to stay near the Poconos!"

Overall I think it was a good find. Only negative is the stairwell is rather narrow so make sure you’re comfortable with hauling your luggage up stairs"

The amenities inside and out were great, the location was low key and relaxing. Highly recommended for anyone trying to wind-down and enjoy nature in the Poconos. The hosts always made themselves available if needed, and had clear instruction for a smooth stay."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I really loved this place. It was equipped with everything we needed and more - the sauna was such a wonderful treat! The house was immaculate and the artful play of patterns, textures, and colors gave it an eclectic vibe. The location was perfect - close to a big supermarket, lots of restaurants and shopping. It was just an hour and 40 minute drive to NJ where we parked and took the PATH to Manhattan for the day. Vera was very easy to communicate with. We definitely recommend this stay!"

Also, their place seems to be a prime proposal location, because we too just got engaged here 10/11/22! Thank you so much Vera and Alex! 💕"

Stayed a few nights","Beautifully appointed, comfy house that was immaculately clean and great for a low key weekend getaway with friends. Backyard amenities including hot tub, fire pit and Turkish sauna were all put to good use and rigorously maintained. Neighboring houses are fairly close by so you feel like you’re definitely in a residential area rather than in a secluded wooded area, but we did not experience any loud noise or intrusions (except for many deer brazenly snacking in surrounding yards)! House is in a gated development so that was positive from a security standpoint, but frustrating from an access standpoint due to lengthy delays to enter through non-resident gates because of high volume of cars that need to stop and be registered (or don’t know how to use guest passes correctly). Our hosts were extremely responsive and professional and checked in with us to make sure we were comfortable and had any needs. Was a bit pricey but overall good value when split among a few friends looking to spend quality time in a lovely setting in the Poconos."

Stayed with kids","Vera's place is an absolute 5-star! the architecture of the house, the furniture, the decorations, the plants, the hot tub and sauna, the arts-covered walls, and the skyline master bathroom. My kids and I are in awe!
Vera was super communicative upon check-in, as well as accommodating for late check-out. The gated community made us feel safe as a mother with two kids. we enjoyed the pool and the 3 lakes. We saw about 20 deer and 3 of them kept showing up in the backyard where the hot tub is.
The location is awesome as well, 10 mins from camelback and 15 mins from tubing/canoeing. We had a great time in the Poconos and are so inspired by Vera's house! Thank you with love!"

We watched the deer, roasted marshmallows around the fire, lazed on the hammock, and enjoyed the hot tub and sauna (such a fun feature!). We are already planning to come back. The hosts clearly put a lot of thought into this beautiful home. Thank you for sharing it with us!"

Stayed with kids","My husband, 11 month old son and I stayed at Vera’s home for 4 nights. The home was perfect for our family vacation. They provided a pack and play for our son to sleep in the second bedroom, while we slept in the king bed in the main bedroom (which was extremely comfortable). The main bathroom has been beautifully renovated with a soaker tub (our son loved playing in the tub on the rainy afternoons). The upstairs is complete with a reading nook and rocking chair where we enjoyed some reading during our son’s naps. The main living area has a comfortable sofa and lounging chairs to watch tv (Netflix/Hulu, etc all available). The outdoor space was also fantastic - we used the grill for making dinners, enjoyed the fire pit, hot tub and sauna in the evenings. The home is located in a nice gated community, we enjoyed short walks around the neighbourhood and playing/swimming at the lake (which is a 5 min drive). We also enjoyed multiple hikes around the Poconos. Would highly recommend!"
