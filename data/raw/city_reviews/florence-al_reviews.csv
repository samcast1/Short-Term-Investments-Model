Stayed a few nights","Spent the weekend at Donny's place for a girl's weekend. We loved that the neighborhood was quiet and secluded yet it was very easy to get downtown or be on the road to Joe Wheeler lake where we had a cruise booked. All basic amenities are in the house, plenty of towels, dishes and glassware. Be aware that you will be washing dishes by hand but we are used to that. The beds are comfortable and we all slept through a nighttime thunderstorm."

Stayed one night",My girlfriend and I came to Florence with a couple of friends for an event. We found this place and it slept all 4 of us very comfortably. From the kitchen to the living room to the bedrooms and bathroom. The place was great for the price. Located in a good spot very close to downtown. A very long list of resturants and things to do in just a short drive or even walk. Would highly reccomend this place for a family coming into town or if you just need a place in general! Hosts were great and thank yall for the hospitality

Stayed with kids","Very strong AC ❄️❤️❄️ As travelers from Texas it was much appreciated! Older home that is charming and neatly kept. Very clean!
As a family of 6 we would have enjoyed enough seating for all of us at the same time at the dining table and living room but the owner is so awesome that I’ll bet they add seating to help future 6 person guests enjoy the space more comfortably.
There are 3 beds total and we have teenagers so we weren’t able to squish 2 people per bed but if all our kids were littles-we would have been just fine.
Another great thing about this host is that they were very accommodating with bringing us extra sheets and pillow for an air mattress we packed to bring.
I would recommend future guests to give this cute stay a chance.
It’s peaceful! Clean and perfect for a hop skip and a jump from many cities and towns nearby."

Group trip","This property was nice, clean and in a great central location. The owner was fantastic in helping us with anything we needed and was very friendly and polite. 3 couples shared this home for a 3 day weekend and had zero issues. Owners had the place well stocked and comfortable. One afternoon it rained and we just enjoyed the time relaxing and watching movies. The comfy blankets were a hit! Our recommendations for future travelers: Go and enjoy Rattlesnake Saloon and The Lost Pizza Co. Our recommendation to the owner from the giant electrician traveling with us: please, raise the dining room light. (He smacked it with his head and the rest of us short people giggled. :) )"

Stayed with kids","The hosts are super accommodating, answer quickly, and are very supportive. The beds are comfortable and a tv in every room. Great for a family with little kids who all want to watch their favorite show. The kitchen had plenty of dishes and silverware and cooking utensils. I did a fair amount of cooking for our meals. While you are in Florence go to Trowbridges downtown for orange pineapple ice cream, on the list of 100 things you should eat before you die. Washer and dryer were a plus, especially with two little children. Back yard is fenced so kids could play outside. Hosts were just great."

Stayed with kids","This home does have a cottage feel to it. The home was clean, organized and well taken care of when we arrived. It is in a very quiet area even on the July fourth weekend. The host left us with plenty of starters for the week such as paper towels, plates, toilet paper, trash bags, etc. We did have a longer stay so the washer and dryer was convenient to have for use. The only issue we ran into was the oven not heating well, and not properly cooking our food. This kinda twisted our plans a little and caused us to dine out more than planned. We chose the home instead of a hotel, so that we could cook together so it was a little bummer to not have that option."

Stayed with kids","The Clayton’s were very nice. They leave a log book of the building of the cabin and sallow you to write about your time there. They leave you a Whittling kit to carve out your name in a tree to “leave your mark” I thought that was really cool and unique. It’s like showing it’s history in the making. Everything was self made, simple, yet beautiful. The shower was amazing. A large rock was put up there by Mr Clayton himself and the shower water runs off it like a spring cave. Lovely and relaxing time in our small 2 day getaway"

The location was minutes away from downtown Florence, but so close to the TN River that we could easily access any of the Shoals cities. My favorite part about the home is the rooftop porch above the garage. Perfect spot to wind down under the stars! I would HAPPILY stay here again! Highly recommend booking The Pine Spring Knoll."

We had everything we needed for a wonderful stay and especially enjoyed ourselves out on the deck where we roasted marshmallows and made s’more’s together! It felt like we were staying somewhere exotic when we were outside under the string lights!
It was hard to pick our favorite room to spend the night in between the two charming bedrooms. But we chose the room with the terracotta ceiling and it felt like a dream to wake up to!
Every detail of the house was carefully and thoughtfully planned out. Couldn’t get enough of the art and decor! It made our visit so unique and also felt like home.
Tessa was a fabulous host and was great at communicating and making sure we had everything we needed and were taken care of! We can’t wait for our next stay here!!
I want everyone to experience it for themselves!"

Stayed a few nights","Haley House was as advertised and perfectly fit my needs. I’m from Birmingham and my Fraternity Brother lives in Nashville. We booked our stay at Haley House to attend our Fraternity’s Founders Day and we couldn’t have picked a better location. Haley House is close to UNA’s campus and there are several stores and restaurants close by. I didn’t really have any issues, but Audrey answered promptly when I called about how to get the blinds to go down in one of the bathrooms and she provided me with easy instructions on how to resolve the issue. I’ll definitely keep Haley House in mind for future visits to Florence or the Shoals area!"

Having a washer and dryer (along with detergent, fabric softener and dryer sheets provided!) Was an awesome amenity when staying more then a day or two. Audrey was great with her instruction on how to get to the large drveway as driving maps will not. Coffee on the back deck in the provided chairs listening to the birds cherp, you would never realize you are in the heart of town. And all of this at an amazing price! Highly recommended!"

Stayed a few nights","My fishing partner and I were down for a weekend tournament . We were blasting off out of McFarland park so, this house was in a perfect location a mile or so in a straight shot right to the ramp. The house was in a very quiet subdivision with plenty of room for my truck and boat, complete with outside receptacle to charge my batteries at night . The house is beautifully furnished with extremely comfortable beds ,Super clean with all the amenities. Our host Audrey was extremely nice and very quick to respond to any questions I had . She made check in and out a breeze. The house is also within blocks of the University and less than a mile to all the downtown Resturants and night life . I’ve stayed in a lot of AirB&b’s but this one was probably right there at the top. I would definitely recommend this house and we will for sure be back next tournament we have in this area !"

We had great stay at your Downtown Florence Condo! Condo was in great shape and very clean. Very comfortable, roomy with a nice brick, hardwood floor, exposed beam interior just like the pics. We visit Florence often and have stayed at other locations. We will definitely return to this Condo! For others, If you enjoy a lively downtown vibe, great food & music, all easily walkable then this Condo will be the perfect fit for your group. Thanks for sharing!"

Stayed a few nights","Dustin’s place was perfection!! We were looking for a nice little getaway without kids and this little piece of heaven was awesome. If you haven’t been to Florence…GO!!! It is just the most charming town with a laid back, fun vibe. There are so many fabulous eateries within walking distance of this loft, along with cute shops and great little bars to grab a drink! We will definitely be coming back to stay here!!"

It is also very roomy and having 2.5 bathrooms is very nice! There are a lot of steps, so be prepared if that is an issue for you."

You are right across the street from Odette (the ""best"" restaurant in Florence with a huge bourbon selection), Billy Reid, several other bars, and just a few blocks from UNA. This weekend was freshman move-in and the city had lots of foot traffic. The downtown is more vibrant than I imagined.
Checkin is a breeze and there is sufficient parking for at least two cars. The loft has three large bedrooms and both the bathrooms are updated and clean. The den/kitchen area overlooks the main ""strip"" of Florence and it was fun watching everything.
There is a large Television in the den/kitchen area with all the channels you need.
I would definitely stay here again."

I reached out to the host to clarify how to lock the door using the keypad and she was very responsive and helpful. The location was convenient to the workshop I attended and a short drive away from downtown and grocery stores. I appreciated the convenience of the Keurig coffee maker for a quick cup before heading to the workshop in the morning. Be aware that the house is close to busy streets, but for me the traffic noise became background noise after the first night there. The cottage on Industry had everything I needed to be comfortable and I would recommend it."

Stayed a few nights","Stephanie's home was a delight
We stayed for three days as we are building south of town and her place is perfectly located 5 mins from all the hustle and bustle of Florence and the Big Box stores --but not in and amongst it.
She has done a truly marvelous job remodeling this little house
It has an air of understated elegance about it
These days Airbnb hosts mostly try too hard to make it perfect and it usually comes up as a ""over the top Kardashian version"" of what they think people want.
Stephanie has achieved just the right blend of old and new and it makes for a very pleasant stayaway experience
We will gladly stay again --if she'll have us..."

If you like nature, there is a wonderful place nearby to walk in trees, wildflowers, streams and waterfalls: Cane Creek Nature Preserve. It’s run by a non-profit, staffed Fri-Sun and offers water and restrooms throughout the miles of trails.
We also visited Fame Studios for a fun tour and regret not having time to stop in at Muscle Shoals Music Studio"

Stayed a few nights","Stephanie was friendly & responsive. Getting in was quick & easy. This little house is beautifully appointed… old house charm with modern, updated decor & amenities = really well done. Nice bathrooms with walk-in showers… laundry… and a full kitchen. No dining room or table, but plenty of counter space & stools. Weather was “Alabama HOT” during our stay, but the HVAC had no trouble keeping things comfortable. In better weather, the back yard would be perfect for a cookout or just sitting. We were in Florence for a family reunion, and it was a great space for my elderly parents to have their own private bedroom/bathroom, and my wife & I to have another. Our son was a late addition to our group for one night, but Stephanie graciously allowed us to add him at no extra charge. There’s not much to the neighborhood, although we did meander down the street to find a walkway down to the Tennessee River. Perfect place for our needs — we had a lovely stay. Thanks!"

Extra blankets and pillow in the closets was a nice extra that we utilized as a family of 5.
House was a little warm upon arrival, but AC was already running so I can tell an effort was being made to get it cool for us.
I would definitely stay again and would 100% recommend."

The house is a quick drive to the downtown area of Florence and the major roadways leading to Muscle Shoals and Tuscumbia which was a plus. The neighborhood was a bit different than we expected with what appears to be an abandoned home next door which may be in the process of being remodeled. The homes in the area are older with some being cared for better than others. Regardless, we did enjoy our time there."

Stayed a few nights",This expertly renovated and tastefully decorated cottage was a delight to stay in. Upscale bathrooms and kitchen with plenty of room for family entertaining made for an enjoyable weekend with extended family. The fire pit in the nicely landscaped backyard was an unexpected plus. Stephanie was responsive to our questions and concerns before and during our stay. We look forward to staying here again the next we get together with family.

Stayed a few nights","We had an absolutely wonderful experience staying in this comfortable and stylish space! The interior design is even more stunning than in the photos—this host has excellent taste in decor and furniture. The attention to detail really made us feel at home here.
This place has got all of the amenities we could even think of and more! The kitchen is fully functional and there are plenty of dishes and kitchenware available to prepare home-cooked meals. They even left a large bag of ice in the freezer which saved us the trouble of going out to buy some when transporting groceries back home in our cooler. Major bonus points for that touch! There are not one, but two 4K Roku TVs, one in the living room and one in the front bedroom. If your travel plans include movie-watching, this is an awesome space for that! The couch and beds are very comfortable as well.
We really enjoyed observing the insect wildlife on the front porch at night—don’t worry, there were *no* bugs inside the house! If you like entomology as much as I do, you’ll love watching moths and tiny caterpillars come out to play when it gets dark. We were just mesmerized by nightly web-weaving. This was such a fascinating aspect of our stay.
If you’re looking for a homely and stylish atmosphere for your stay in Florence, this is the place for you. It is cozy, contemporary, and conveniently located only minutes away from downtown. I can guarantee that you will feel safe and at home here—I know I did. Do not hesitate to book this outstanding cottage, you will fall in love!"

Stayed a few nights","We rented this lovely and serene residence for our stay to visit family and friends and to have my mom's 80th Birthday event. It could not have been more perfect for that occasion. The main living area is set up perfectly for setting out catered food and drinks with lots of wide spaces for those at our event who are up in age and have walkers or canes. The back patio looking out across Shoals Creek was the focus of where everyone wanted to be though, and it too is set up well for enjoying yourself easily. It is well worth the winding, narrow roads you have to drive to get to it, which also makes it quite and peaceful. Also, both Shannon the manager and Katherine the owner were so responsive and proactive in all communication and requests that they made everything so seamless. Will definitely rent again if we need a space in my hometown again!"

Stayed about a week","What a magical 8 days - didn't want to leave!
This glorious home renews and restores you. The views are unmatched - across one of the widest parts of Shoals Creek. And the bird life is wonderful -including white pelicans, ospreys and bald eagles! Saw birds I have never seen before. Siting out on teh back deck or the dock was so peaceful and relaxing.
The house is very well equipped, with very comfortable beds, pillow, and seating. The two recliners are the best we have ever sat in. And the decor and furnishings/artwork are superb. Guess you can tell we loved it all :)"

Stayed a few nights","Exquisite, luxury, waterfront home is the PERFECT description and experience that we had during our week long stay at this home. Shannon anticipated every need and exceeded all expectations with all of the detailed nuances that went in to designing and preparing this home for guests.
This home is on par with Ritz Carlton or Four Season properties sans room service. However, room service is not necessary when you have a true completely outfitted chef's kitchen in which to prepare meals and a lovely lake view patio dining area to enjoy the cuisine. There is a Publix market less than 5 miles away to purchase all of the provisions needed. We never left this home except to go to the store. InstaCart also delivers to this home if you do not want to shop.
The dock seating area is a must for the golden hour sunset view of the lake and wildlife. And to watch the ""Stars fall on Alabama"" at night.
The beds are comfortable and the linens are superb for sleeping. The master bathroom is a true spa like experience with the soaking tub and the walk in shower.
The lawn is like a golf course - immaculate and waiting for a competitive game of bags or just lie down to look at the clouds.
We will return to this magical and peaceful place. Thank you Shannon!"

After your coffee on the dock, take the best shower of your life in that master bathroom 🛀. We will definitely book here again!"

Even the great pictures don’t capture all of the beauty and greatness of this home! We had everything we needed, right there in the home. And even if we didn’t, it was just a very short drive into town. The lines of communication were always open and we had no issues getting in contact with our host for anything. She was extremely pleasant to work with, very thorough and kept us well informed. This home was perfect for my family and I actually look forward to booking here again!"

Stayed one night","There is lots to do in the area, decent room to spread out with comfortable chairs and bed.
Unfortunately it needs a good cleaning and there were ants along the floor and wall by the front window.
We specifically booked the apartment because of the pool and commented on it in our booking months ago only to be told a couple hours before we arrived that it is not useable. Clarification on when it is available or not needs to be put in the listing.
We also had the tornado sirens go off while we were there - obviously not the owners responsibility but information on where to go should be listed in the apartment - the storm shelter is in the church behind the apartment and easy to get to."

The bath towels were fluffy and soft. The studio is conveniently located in a walkable neighborhood. There are numerous restaurants, coffee shops, antique stores, hardware stores, salons and barber shops, clothing stores, pharmacy, a grocery and package store and several churches. A fenced dog park is located across the street. The studio is located in a great area!"

A few things to note (these did not make or break our stay) - the antique tub was very cute but did make getting ready a little tricky. The space is above the garage so you can hear every time the host comes or goes. The neighbors outdoor dog did bark a lot. But still a great stay!

I was a little worried about only having a bathtub, but the tub is very deep and I ended up really enjoying it. The pool made the place for me, it is a good size and kept clean. Also, the location is very close to downtown Florence and stays pretty quiet at night! Chase and his family are great people, they respond very quickly and the place grew to feel like home. I would definitely stay again!"

It’s also very close to the University, which has a gorgeous open campus that’s worth walking through. The studio itself is cozy, and the bed is very comfortable. As listed it has a kitchenette and a lovely bathtub with a detachable shower head, making it suitable for a sit down shower. Although I didn’t have the opportunity to meet Chase in person, I felt very welcome and appreciated his incredibly fast responses. Privacy is definitely respected as well.

No photos from weird directions that work like food commercials (which don't feature actual food), the pictures always realistically show the listing. She gives impeccable instructions online, everything is easy to do, and she keeps a binder in each of the places. It tells you the Wi-Fi, check in, and check out on the cover; inside it, amenities and places to visit. Her listings are very tastefully decorated with care and twinkling lights, and everything looks clean and new no matter where you go. Now I only stay in her listings. Go with Savanna if you want every vacation to go exactly like you think it will before you leave home."

Warning: the walls and windows let in all the sounds! You know whenever someone enters or exits the stairwell (there are 3 other apartments in the building), and you can hear car traffic easily. Nothing a white noise app on my phone couldn't solve when I needed to sleep, though! It also wasn't enough to give under 5 stars for anything.

The home is spacious and very comfortable. Plenty of extra special touches throughout the place… comfy throw blankets, comfy furniture, nice size TV’s in every room, remote controlled ceiling fans, well lighted, blinds with curtains (I’m always surprised when places don’t have adequate window shades/blinds).
The location is perfect! Plenty of restaurants within walking distance.
Savanna was very responsive and a great host! I’m returning to Florence in a few weeks and was disappointed her place was booked! She offered another place, which I happily agreed as I have no doubt it’ll be perfect!"

Florence is a well maintained historic town with a small university. Within just a few blocks are a dozen different restaurants, plus coffee, ice cream, boba, a brewery and even an escape room.
An indian mound and a Frank Lloyd Wright house are less than 10 minutes away. Within 15 is an art museum and the birth place of Helen Keller. There are many diverse interests in the area! We did not even explore the recording industry side of things."

It was only a 10 minute walk from the front door to directly outside the college dorm where my kids were moving in. Perfect in every way. We didn’t want to leave. One of my sons even chose to stay with us for the week instead of his new dorm because the second bedroom was so comfortable and spacious. That meant the world to this soon-to-be empty-nester mama who’s DYING inside losing all three of my triplets to college at the same time. 🥹Good memories made!"

There is a dock, so you are welcome to bring your own boat or take advantage of the rentals available to you through a third party. We found the entire house to be very clean and well organized. We especially liked having the light switches labeled and directions posted at key spots in the house to help guests. The house rules book was very professionally put together and most helpful. Mike was always available to answer any questions we had. We would love to come back and stay here again and highly recommend Mike's place to anybody considering a stay in this part of paradise."

Being so close to Christmas, they even had a tree put up and other decor around the home. Nice touches everywhere. This home was chosen to spend some family time and just reconnect. Highly recommend and I will be back as well. Thank you!"

The house and grounds are very well kept. We had a so much fun fishing off the dock. We caught so many fish. The kids loved it. We really enjoyed the screened in porch.

The lake was great for fishing, boating and swimming. Very quiet and peaceful. I think the best part was everything!! The restaurants he recommends are great however we did not eat out but I grew up in Florence so been to all of them before this rental. My husband and son rode their motorcycles and enjoyed riding the Natchez Trace. We had all our family with us to grill and just enjoy the family company and this was a perfect place for a reunion. I would definitely recommend Mike and his place to anyone. We will be back next year for another week stay!!!"

The cottage was beautifully quaint and clean, with all the necessary amenities for a comfortable stay. The location was perfect, just a short walk from downtown but in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood.
I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the cottage and found it to be a delightful retreat. The host was friendly and accommodating, making sure that everything was in order for my stay. I would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a cozy and charming place to stay.
Overall, my experience at the 1945 cottage on wood was fantastic and I would definitely stay there again. Thank you to the host for providing such a lovely and enjoyable accommodation.”"

The location is very convenient to events at UNA or in downtown Florence. Many shops and restaurants are within walking distance but if you decide to drive, the driveway allows you to pull in from the street and exit via the alley (or vice versa) without turning around.
If you are looking for a base for exploring the Florence area or a quiet place to hide away for a while, this is a great place."

Karla (owner) is super responsive & helpful. Recommend Odette and Ricatoni's for dinner, and Jack's Place for lunch. Wildwood Tavern, Singing River Brewery, and The Carriage Wine & Market are all good for drinks. Florence is a cute town and the House is within walking distance of everything you need for a short stay. I can't say I've ever stayed anywhere before where I've heard a Lion roar, that's something memorable."

Walkable to anyplace downtown or to the historic districts adjoining. We felt like we hit the jackpot with this rental. My husband and I and our adult daughter stayed; there was an additional single bed available that we did not use. Would stay again in a heartbeat. Thanks, Karla!"

It is located in a lovely, historic area on one of Florence’s prettiest streets. The home is laid out incredibly well for a family with children or for two couples. The host is so nice and had thought of everything! The home has everything you could need for your stay. We hope to stay here again soon!"

Stayed with kids","You won't want to leave this place once you're there! Karla is an amazing host - she even left a fresh baked treat for the kids. The house was clean, the amenities were wonderful, the location was perfect! One of the highlights of the trip was visiting the UNA lions across the street. The kids loved going on little adventures on campus. There are good family friendly restaurants nearby, but honestly, you won't want to leave the home much. It's cozy and comfortable and we will definitely be back again!"

Stayed a few nights","The house was wonderful. There were thoughtful touches from the cheese biscuits and pepper jelly to all of the toiletries available. The home is great for two couples with all the privacy you would ever want, plus a bonus bed for and extra person as well. The kitchen had everything we needed including the coffee and filters available (although we brought our own)! The property is located just a short walk from the quaint downtown of Florence and it’s music ventures, restaurants and small boutiques. We absolutely loved the home and had a wonderful time in Florence...... the neighbors are very friendly and great advisors of things to do if you catch them outside!! Sweet people!!"

Stayed a few nights","We booked this home for a few days during a UNA commencement week and were pleased with the amenities and furnishings for our family. Staying on Wood Avenue is always a treat as the historic charm is second to none and so many activities and dining within walking distance! You can even hear the live lions roaring at the UNA Lion Habitat across the way, just inside the campus boundary.
We did a fair amount of cooking for family and noted the back patio does not have a barbeque grill, but the new stainless kitchen appliances are quite nice and the waterfall sink is really handy. There is plenty of countertop space, although care needs to be taken if you do any cooking, as there is no backsplash, as yet, surrounding the countertops. There is a Mr. Coffee maker, but we noted no Kuerig if that is your preference. The extra deep freeze in the utility room is a godsend for fishermen.
The home has some very nice touches with period furnishings and wall sconces with what appear to be live hydrangea bud vases with a very nice frangrance. The beds were very comfortable and rooms had adequate space for luggage and belongings. The master ensuite shower is not pictured in the listing, but beautiful, modern with farmhouse charm and the second full bath has a tub/shower combo with modern vanity and both baths are very spaceous.
Many of the rooms have arched doorways, adding to the overall character of the home. The living room has a television with many cable selections, as well as local channels and there is a cabinet with a nice selection of board and card games which our teens enjoyed.
The back entry steps are rather steep with several stairs up to the door, but the front entry is more level and a good alternative if you have knee or joint issues. We very much enjoyed the front porch. Though it is rather small, with a chair or two is so very nice in the evenings to enjoy chatting with family or friends. There is a light and a ceiling fan for cooling the area and each morning we enjoyed our coffee on the porch with a view of Wood Avenue birds, squirrels and the occaisional passerby.
Whether you are an overnight guest looking for a brief stay and dining out most of the time, or perhaps you like to cook and are looking to stay awhile, this home is charming and we'll certainly be keeping it on our list for return trips to Florence!"

Group trip","This was the cutest, cleanest, most perfect Cottage in Florence! Karla is an amazing hostess. She even had fresh flowers, homemade cheese crisp and homemade pepper jelly for us to enjoy upon our arrival. Wish I could go back every weekend! We gave it 5 stars."
