Stayed with kids","Russel is a great host who is accommodating and easy to communicate with. The location is as advertised, with great options for fishing, kayaking or relaxing. Access to the water is unsecured, so be mindful, as the post states, in regards to your children. Overall the place is great and the host makes it easy.
Thanks Russel"

Kevin responded very quickly to any questions I had. My niece just bought a home less than a mile away so I will be returning to stay. I would recommend this super cute house to anyone who would like to stay there. The pictures did not do it justice it was much cuter."

Stayed with a pet","Kevin’s place was excellent, we were road weary and it gave us a comfortable space to rest up. We had one issue with the heat pump/ac, after several text Kevin sent a YouTube video, FYI there is a slide panel below the three top buttons with more adjustments, after that there were no issues. If you’re short like me it’s difficult to access the dryer controls, my husband came in handy for that. We didn’t cook but it’s a very nicely stocked kitchen. The fenced yard was perfect for us and the dog, she loved it. We enjoyed resting on the couches and watching movies. Would definitely rate higher than 5 stars if I could."

Stayed a few nights","Very charming apartment and quite comfortable. No dishwasher, if that matters to you, and agree with another reviewer about the space at the end of the bed. If you’re a larger person or have mobility issues you might have a tough time accessing the little closet at the far side of the bed. It’s not really important for a short stay; plenty of places to hang things in the rest of the apartment, and a dresser also is easily accessible in-room. Initial two handed entry to the building frustrating if one hand is full, but it is what it is for a beautiful older building, and you adjust! Honestly, this place is a LOT cuter than it looks in pictures. Thank you for the stay, Whitney, I’ll definitely rebook!"

Stayed a few nights","Cozy and calming are two words that describe Whitney’s home. From the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed and settled. The apartment is darling and had ample space for my weekly work hybrid visit. The home is modern, yet retains the antique charm of its age. The bed is sumptuous, and I immediately fell asleep with the fuzzy quilts and feather pillows. Longview was a perfect location for my job in Oregon and offered beautiful tree lined streets, quaint shops, and yummy restaurants. Be sure to check out The Merk building, adorned with history of Longview, its wonderful shops, and Holos Yoga. Unfortunately, I did not have a chance to check out Lake Sacajawea or the wonderful restaurant recommendations from Whitney, but I know that I can save those adventures for my next trip to Longview and will definitely book this stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","Whitney’s apartment was wonderful. It’s nestled in a safe neighborhood. The apartment has a relaxed homey type feel. We spent several nights there and rarely heard or saw the other tenants.
The bed was very comfortable and all the linens were clean. Extra blankets were available in the closet. We didn’t need them. One thing worth mentioning, is the bed was a tight fit in the small room. There is only about 1 ft clearance at the end of the bed. It wasn’t a big issue for us, but it could possibly be for some people. There is plenty of room on both sides of the bed.
We cooked frequently in the kitchen. All the appliances were in good working condition. Some of the basics were available: sugar, oil, some spices, coffee.
I loved the essential oils that were available to use with a defuser. It was a nice touch.
The TV has Netflix and cable, although we never used it. The internet worked very well.
We would definitely stay again. We felt right at home."

The bed was very comfortable.  We loved walking around the neighborhood.  We even walked down to the park several times, and on Thursday evening, we went to the free concert.  It was so much fun.  If we are ever out in Washington again, we would definitely stay here. "

Stayed about a week","I love Longview so much，
so I chose this century-old apartment，which is located in a beautiful tree-lined street. The apartment is very cozy and with everything you need. The creaking of the upstairs and floor of the room takes you through the ages and has a retro atmosphere. Whitney is very considerate, but there may be some misunderstanding,it is a pity that I was not able to renew my reservation. I had to repack and change accommodation before the end of my trip and business in Longview, which left me in a hurry."

The bed/pillows were more comfortable than mine at home. My boyfriend and I came here to stay for a wedding and it was the perfect quiet place to hang out when family chaos was too much. We loved absolutely everything about this space. Whitney was so communicative and understanding, she made our stay so easy and seamless. We will absolutely be staying here again when we come back up to visit family. My boyfriend and I have too many great things to say about this place and it made our entire trip to Longview to call this place our ""home."""

Bedroom is great, bathroom is great, kitchen is great, living room is great. This is in a great part of town, easy walking distance to Lake Sacagawea, Lower Columbia College, or historic downtown.
Whitney is a kind, communicative, and accommodating host. I really can't think of any reason not to stay here if you're looking to spend some time in Longview."

The neighborhood is residential, pleasant, quiet, and charming. It is just a few minutes walk to downtown (in one direction) and the large, beautiful Lake Sacajawea Park (in the other direction). Longview is very friendly.
One note: the only parking is on-street, but there was always space."

The kitchen provided everything we needed, the bed was very comfortable and overall it was very clean. Extra supplies, linens and bedding were tucked away in the surprisingly ample closet spaces. And yes, once in a while you hear the creaky floors from above, which only adds to the atmosphere of staying in a 1920's building. It's a great location for walking through the quiet neighborhood and down to the lake. Finding parking was also never a problem. Whitney was very welcoming, accommodating and helpful. We had a wonderful time and hope to come back for another stay."

The house is a cozy, charming spot nestled in a park-like neighborhood. Little details like an old-fashioned record player made it feel like home. (Whitney personally shared some of her records for us to enjoy.) We stayed long term, for several months, and loved it. The neighbors are kind and fun to be around, and there is a garden in the back that is very peaceful. The house has a very compact, functional layout, full of natural light, with a spacious living room, single bedroom and small kitchen. The kitchen has everything you need to effectively feed two people, but does lack elbow room. We adapted the living room into an office area and it worked phenomenally well."

Group trip","Luke’s property was gorgeous. We used it as a home base for choosing which area to buy in in March - I’d buy this one if it was listed. We spent a week there for Christmas as a family (my siblings and I and their kids) and I have to say having three bathrooms was a bonus! We felt right at home and there was plenty of space for my siblings and I to talk amongst ourselves in different groups (and seating!) and kids to play. The crockpot was a win and made big meals like spaghetti and tacos for an army easy to clean up after. We appreciated the home having supplies to accommodate us.
We all loved the area - a tip is that many carriers lose service at the bottom of rose hill drive. You’ll get it again at the house.
There are some great local restaurants in Longview/kelso. I recommend Nipps, Pepe’s, Stuffys II and Mill City Grill. We live county line park and the public market in Kalama."

Luke was great at communicating with us and that made me feel like we chose the right place to stay. We would definitely book this home again when we need a wonderful place to stay in this area.
Hands down, a great stay and host. Thank you for allowing us to stay at your property."

The property is beautiful with adorable bunnies hopping all over the place. The indoor space was comfy and cozy with just about every home amenity someone could want -- it was easy to feel at home.
As a host, Luke was wonderful. We had some last minute guest changes and he worked with us to get everything resolved, even when we were en route. He made it easy to just show up and relax. Very much appreciated!"

We arrived on the 4th of July, and Luke was very helpful in supplying information about what fireworks he would accept before I had to ask. We found the place was peaceful and very private, as described, with the bonus of quaint local wildlife that would scamper and play in the garden. We appreciated the wood for the firepit and the tiki torch fuel that repelled mosquitos. The bed was comfortable, and there were plenty of extra blankets and pillows if needed. The kitchen was stocked with the essentials and a bit more. The TV had a good amount of channels for kids and adults, and there was easy access to wifi. Luke was very helpful and communicative, providing good directions to the house, check in and check out info, and offering to answer questions. He was a super host for sure. We would definitely consider staying here again."

Stayed with kids",Luke has a beautiful cottage! My sister lives in the area so I rented this cottage to bring all my family from out of town together and it worked wonderfully. The kitchen is nice and big and has everything you need to cook any type of meal. The welcome amenities show that the owner is an intuitive host who really cares about your stay. The bedrooms were exactly as described and fit 4 adults and three children with no problem. The horse shoes and multiple fire pits are a very nice touch. The cottage is surrounded by thick forest and seeing multiple bunny rabbits and deer was a common site. My family really loved the Horseshoes and being outside. I would highly recommend staying here to my friends and will stay here next time I am in town. The pictures do not do it justice.

Group trip","The Serene Cottage in the Woods was a perfect place for us to stay while in Washington to attend my cousin's funeral. The weather was amazing! But the beautiful weather seemed to bring out the stink bugs, which has been a problem for everyone that lives in Washington. My only complaint was that the stink bugs seemed to like the Serene Cottage in the Woods as much as we did - and the complaint is not against Luke or the cottage, just the bugs. Luke sent someone out immediately when I sent him a message letting him know that the stink bugs were in the house. This was my first time using a Airbnb, and I will be using them again, because of Luke and his team and how well they listened and responded to us."

Stayed about a week","We stayed here for a week while visiting family in Kelso. The photos don’t do the property justice. It is gorgeous and gives you the feeling that you are in the deep woods with the benefit of only being 10-15 minutes away from shopping, restaurants and entertainment. Do yourself a favor and wake up with the sun so you can enjoy deer and bird watching. Our family took advantage of the horseshoe and large fire pit areas, and the hot tub was an added bonus during cool morning/evenings. We also enjoyed opening the master bedroom windows to listen to the water fountain while falling asleep. Luke was an excellent host with one priority - making sure your stay is perfect. I cannot wait to return next year!"

It was perfect for our kids, it had 2 extra rooms upstairs, one with a bunk bed. Also we loved they supplied eggs, butter, and milk and tons of spices, coffee, and other kitchen items that made cooking on the go easier. The outdoor area was wonderful, we enjoyed the fire pit, watering the flowers, and playing horseshoes. The woods were so quiet and private. We also enjoyed watching a mama doe and her two spotted baby deer walking around every day. It's just a special and quiet location, I recommend it to anyone wanting to have privacy and to be in peace."

Our kids 2, and 4 enjoyed playing in the snow just outside the house. Since this place is up in the woods it does take about 10 min to get down to town which was not bad because the scenery and drive is nice! Once on the main roads there's a Target and shopping malls with theater.
The home was air-conditioned and heated, the refrigerator was kindly stocked with essential condiments, milk and eggs. The home is 2 stories, the bottom floor has the living room kitchen and the king bedroom with restroom the top floor has bunk beds and a queen bedroom. Which was more than comfortable for our family. We definitely enjoyed our stay and will stay here again!"

Very close to towns of Rainier, Longview and Kelso."

The house was very clean, and the host was great at communicating. The hot tub is an inflatable hot tub that takes some time to warm up, but it was a nice bonus to be able to enjoy it on a chilly evening. Convenient to shopping and restaurants in Kelso/Longview, and only about 45 minutes to Portland. It was a great home base to explore Washington and Oregon for a few days with friends. There aren't many airbnb options in this area, and this is one I'd highly recommend."

The house had nice towels provided and many amenities like snacks and coffee filters, creamers & sugar provided. There were even some kids toys and a kid-sized table that my kids loved. There is a cute covered back porch with dining table and kids picnic table. All of the furniture was comfortable."

We were in town for a funeral so it was really helpful and meant a lot to us. The home is lovely and the beds are very comfortable. we would highly recommend it. My son even left his wallet in the home and they helped us get it back immediately. very appreciative of their hospitality.

We loved how close we were to the lake and enjoyed walking around it as well as letting the kids play at several of the playgrounds within walking distance. We loved the fenced in playground just a couple blocks away.
We also enjoyed having meals around the table in the shaded, fenced back yard. It was very peaceful back there.
We would definitely stay here again if we visit Longview in the future."

Lake Saqajewea (sp?) is a beautiful place to walk with a nice large park and basketball court nearby. Kayak rentals from the Parks and Rec were only $22 for 2 hours. The only thing that I would mention is that bath time for babies or toddlers is challenging since the tub is deep, and it has sliding glass doors, one side of which is blocked by the vanity. So you have to reach far to get to the bath controls and the bath plug. But besides that, everything was great!!"

Easy access to and from I-5, and centrally located in town, which is nice.
Having grown up in the area, I can vouch that a lake facing property is one of the most desirable pieces of real estate in town.
While you’re here, be sure to check out Mt St Helens (it’s only about an hour drive or so) , and try to catch all 7 squirrel bridges in town!"

The entire house was very clean and had all the household amenities you could need. The kitchen had every pot/pan/utensil you would need, and seasonings too. Loved that every room had extra pillows and blankets in the closets. The dining room had a huge table with plenty of space for the whole family and more. The living room was furnished with the best, comfy oversized sofas, which was perfect for watching a movie on a cold, rainy night in November. We also loved the welcome basket with goodies and chocolates on the beds. Definitely the only place we will stay when we go to Longview!
The only thing I would change is to update the bathroom. It was perfectly fine for me, but I was traveling with my elder father and it seemed like the shower tub wall was higher than standard and was a little difficult for a person with some mobility issues to use. Again, this wouldn’t be an issue for most people, but just something to be aware of."

We loved having the chickens just outside our backdoor. The outdoor porch swing with lovely landscaping was a nice place for a glass of wine at the end of the day. We cooked our evening meal there and had all the amenities we needed. Loads of DVDs to watch and books to read while sitting on a comfy couch. We also enjoyed the fresh eggs and pancake mix AJ had left us for breakfast. Highly recommend AJ's place.

It is a little off the beaten path, however the view, location and privacy only comes with a true, country setting. AJ's kitchen is ONE of the best Airbnb kitchens we have ever used. So clean, well stocked, quality tools and appliances. Nothing about this kitchen or home says temporary or passing through. It feels like a well designed place waiting to host. We loved the breakfast provisions, the clean well water, the DVD collection, the large bathroom vanity, the laundry facility, the EASY access parking, the thoughtful liens and sleeping options. This little place JUST HAD EVERYTHING we could need. 5 stars for sure."

It's in a beautiful location, and although attached to the main house, you wouldn't know it. It's peaceful and private; the only company are the chickens in the back yard (who are pretty chilled and quiet).

The setting was quiet and private, but proximity to activities and dining was still convenient. Just enough wifi to give us scrolling time, and a broad (and well labeled) movie selection and games to keep us occupied when needing to unplug.

The fresh eggs were delicious, house manual had all the information we needed, and there were lots of nice touches to make the place feel like a cozy getaway. I was just stopping over for the night, and didn’t get to enjoy the sauna, but it looked like it would have been a real treat.
Be prepared for a bumpy gravel driveway (plus a very steep paved section of the driveway), but the hideaway at the end of the driveway is worth it! You can tell that the hosts are really working hard to make this a special place."

We even changed our minds days before arriving that we didn't want to leave so early after day 2 of the tournament so he assisted me with extended our stay. Super easy and stress free. The home was comfortable and had room for everyone. The hot tub was a huge plus and all the games and air hockey/pool table kept everyone entertained. Our 5-year-old enjoyed playing on the play set in the mornings. Thank you for hosting us! We will check your listing out again if we are in the area.

Stayed with kids","We were a family of two grandparents, two parents and 4 kids. This home was perfect for us and I hope to stay there again some day. It had everything we needed and everything was top quality - furniture, beds, linens, towels, dishes, appliances, cookware, televisions, washer/dryer, etc. We were welcomed with sparkling cider and popcorn (although it wasn't used) and the master bath had a tray of toothpaste, toothbrushes, dental floss, razors, things a person might forget to pack. We were not in the house for a good part of each day, but when we were, the kids (and adults) had a great time playing pool, ping pong, or air hockey on the three-way table, and the games on the walls were a hit. Hot tub was only used once, but it was clean and enjoyable. Playscape was only used one evening but the kids loved it. Basketball game in the garage was also a hit. Only problem was with a shower fixture on our last evening, but we made do. I very highly recommend this home to any family."

We notified Kathleen and she did everything in her power at that point to fix the issue, including sending a housekeeper the next day and offering us a partial refund. Kathleen was very responsive through AirBNB messaging and via phone call. We had some issues with the lock box when coming and going, nothing major but it does require a little extra time and maneuvering. The apartment itself looks like the photos and is well stocked. The washer and dryer are inside of the main house, which is currently being rented by four tenants. I only mention this because I didn't know that when booking, though Kathleen did notify us in a message prior to arrival. I only saw the tenants in passing and they seemed friendly. Also, if you are hot natured be aware that there is no AC in the fall-winter but there is a screened window you can open."

One bonus is that there is a 110v outlet on the garage and I was able to plug my EV in and add a few miles overnight. The house is in a very nice neighborhood, which was very quiet with the exception of other tenants at the house coming in very late. I found the space perfectly comfortable with the exception that I personally do not prefer overly firm beds, which I found this to be. Otherwise, it was a very quick stay for me and would have no problem recommending staying here to anyone who sleeps well on firm beds."

Bed was incredibly comfortable and shower was fantastic.
She was VERY responsive to a few questions I had. It is within few of beautiful Lake Sacajawea and I enjoyed walking over to that park.
I will stay here again!"

Stayed one night","TV didn't work, no instructions. Lock box a pure pain, coming and leaving. Spent 30 minutes both times. Called finally and was resolved upon entry, not so much when leaving. Although we didn't cook it was well stocked as stated. Comfortable bed and so appreciative of the air conditioning. Really wish that someone who is renting their could assist. As listed stairs were involved, but narrow and difficult. Would I stay again, maybe if it was for more than 1 night."

Being so close to the Lake made it easy to get out for a quick walk. I wished I was a traveling nurse so I could come again, stay longer and work within walking distance from St. John's Hospital. It was easy to get in and the arrival time after 4 pm was flexible. I couldn't be happier."

Stayed a few nights","The apartment had everything a traveller needs for a comfortable stay. It was unusually hot during my stay, but the unit cooled down at night. I was disappointed in the cleanliness of the kitchen and bathroom upon arrival--I think perhaps a cleaning was missed, so I wiped down all the bathroom and kitchen surfaces myself. This seemed odd considering how well the place presented, so it may have been an isolated incident. If you are sensitive to light and it disturbs your sleep, please note the fabric blinds are thin and not blackout fabric. There are several street lamps around, and the room is not very dark at night. Overall a good stay."

Stayed one night","Pros: Great location with lovely park across the street.
Very clean and well appointed.
Well-stocked kitchen with various food items - really nice touch.
Easy check-in & check-out, great communication, off-street parking.
Cons: Only one ""lounging chair"" (two small wood chairs with table, bed)
Air conditioner is loud.
Windows small (not a ton of natural light) & no screens for opening windows.
Unfortunately, we did not get a good night's sleep in spite of the comfortable bed. While it was not super hot outside while we were there, the apartment was quite warm. We turned on the air conditioner (not central air) and used the very small portable fan. The air conditioner was quite loud and the level of loudness fluctuated throughout the night, which would frequently awaken us. If this issue had not been present, we would have given 5 stars."

Listing is upfront about proximity to the rest of the property but it can be quite noisy with the household just the other side of some very thin walls and doors and children running around upstairs. All quiet at night with only the odd train. Earplugs were available if needed."

Stayed with kids","Good location, rented as a place for our daughter, son-in-law, and their three kids to stay while they were in town for a wedding. Their main complaint was that it was very loud, could hear the television upstairs and the homeowner snoring above them and earplugs aren't really possible for children. Communication was great and the house was comfortable otherwise, it was just difficult with small children due to the noise. They ended up not staying the second night and just drove home after the wedding."

We picked up groceries at a store close by and easily found everything we needed to cook dinner. We only stayed one night because we were just passing through but wished we could have stayed longer. On our way out of town, we visited “Nutty Narrows” a suspension bridge just for squirrels! It’s by the old center of town with 100+ year old trees. It’s a slice of history to see this old planned city still being used and cared for!"

Stayed about a week","I stayed in Longview for a work trip. Jim and Dru’s place was perfect for that. The kitchen had everything needed to cook a meal. The area is spacious and well-lit despite being a ‘basement.’ It really doesn’t feel like a basement at all and I’m a fairly tall guy. Comfy seating for watching television after a long day and a very large comfy bed for a good night’s sleep. There’s also a large outdoor area for soaking up some sun if you’re in the mood. The only drawback would be the thin walls and ceiling. If they’re being active or watching something upstairs, you will hear it. There’s also a train that runs about twice a day that is fairly loud. Considering the price and the abundance of space, and the nice television and the comfort, a little extra noise wasn’t too bad for me at all."

The master bedroom didn’t had curtains the trees covered the windows and give you natural privacy but we still felt a little uncovered."

She gave great local recommendations and helped us out on a few occasions with some needs during our stay. The only thing to be aware of is that when you park in the driveway, it’s a bit of a short truck on a stone path to the stairs to the front door. We were able to get in and then open the garage for loading so it worked out great still, but always like to call that out for unpacking and mobility needs.
Definitely would stay here again in Longview!"

I travel to Rainier for work once a month and the location and amenities are perfect. Quiet, cozy, and everything you need in an Airbnb. I love feeding the goats and pig and lying in the hammock is divine. If you have time, have Kristin tell you the story of the Tiny House Hillside Hideaway, it’s truly a treat! My goal is to have my own tiny house one day and this is a perfect opportunity to try it out. Also, I cannot wait to return this summer when the family tiny house will be complete so I can share this gem with my family. I have stayed in the winter and spring and they are equally tranquil. The sunrises and views are amazing and it makes you want to jump out of bed to greet the day. The drive up the hill on the winding road feels like you are entering a rainforest or something out of the Lord of the Rings with the moss covered gates."

The pictures don't do its justice: the view is spectacular, and the house is full of gadgets and accommodations just in the right place, even table games! You feel the welcoming atmosphere everywhere with these arrangements made by the host, which reminds me of the good old days of airbnb when it's not that commercialized. The caring feeling brings home-like aura and can be therapeutic for those who need a weekend retreat. Feeding the goats and pigs while having breakfast are one of a kind life experience. Llama is usually refined and elegant and tend not to fight for the treats like others do. Waking up midnight and see all the stars from the bed is super romantic. You can either enjoy the warmth and coziness inside or take a walk in the serene surroundings. I usually don't write reviews this long but I just have too many to say otherwise my soul will complain. Highly recommend!!"

Woke up to deer and goats just outside the tiny house with a beautiful view of the water that was a surprise!
Coffee with the animals was a lovely way to start the day.
Saving this one for my next stay when our that way. Nicely done Kristin."

We enjoyed having breakfast on the covered patio and feeding the animals after. There were small pigs, goats and a Llama.

All in all, a great stay."

Everything is so perfect, except the mean goats who bully the piggies :( But seriously, this place is gorgeous, peaceful, and much bigger than you expect from the outside.
Also, Kristin is the only Airbnb I’ve had in the almost decade I’ve been using the app that doesn’t require you to do any chores! Kristin seriously cares about your experience.
THANK YOU!
PROS:
- piggies
- llamas
- goats (when they’re not being bullies)
- the view
- pregnant farm cat
- the aesthetic and cleanliness of the time home
CONS:
- bully goats
- small tv (but this honestly doesn’t matter)
- I didn’t take an extra day off work and stay another night"

It’s very scenic and peaceful, and we got to feed baby goats and piglets! The only drawback was that in July 2023 the shower was functionally unusable because of lack of temperature regulation: it could be set to blazing hot or freezing cold with no in-between. I’m not super picky about shower temps, but I couldn’t use it."

We also loved the welcome wagon of goats and pigs who came up to the fence upon our arrival.
Also the place was very private despite being in their property. So if that’s a concern, I can attest that you have a lot of space and privacy.
Couldn’t recommend this place enough!! We can’t wait to be back."

1. The house is really cozy, clean and kept tidy,
2. The animals there are very cute and always greeted us in the morning (my favorite was Willburg the biggest of three pigs, who actually acted like a dog),
3. The host Kristin. We were there for my birthday and she even baked small cookies for me. In addition they just had baby goats and we even got the chance to hold them and pet them.
I would recommend this tiny house to anybody who likes animals and a very quiet and relaxing atmosphere."

Stayed a few nights","This lovely tiny home provided by Kristin was absolutely magical. The drive was steep, but lovely when greeted by everyone so kindly! The parking was perfect. The view was spectacular. All the animals were so friendly and was an amazing experience to feed them/read about their back stories! Throughout the day and night, being in the tiny home, was the most peaceful place I’ve ever came across. This whole experience has only got me wanting to come back again, so I can experience the fire pit and roast marshmallows to make s’mores! Overall, the most unique and perfect getaway for anyone looking for a peaceful time. Absolutely well done Kristin, thank you for letting me stay here! :)"

A great chance to get away from all of it for a long weekend :)"

Kristin was so informative and always got back with any questions we had in a timely manner. She was great to work with and very helpful.
The price was amazing!!! There was a little book to write about your stay for others to read. Some people were from the UK and other places. Everyone enjoyed this stay so much.
Don’t pass up your opportunity to stay here you will enjoy it so much.
Place to have a small fire outside at night as you watch the sun set or rise over the valley.

Stayed a few nights","I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars,
Kristin and Matt made sure we were comfortable and taken care of multiple times during our stay.
The tiny house was sparkly clean and accommodating. It's a perfect spot to explore Washington and Oregon State, the location has beautiful views and it's very easy to drive around. Remembering that you are in the mountains, so to get to the house there's a gravel way, that is better if you have a bigger car, sports cars are not good with the road LOL
One thing that impressed me very much was the attention to detail, you can tell that Kristin and Matt LOVE to host, from all they make available in the kitchen, so you can cook nice homemade meals, to the variety of pillows, so you can choose one that suits you best, this experience is on TOP of my list.
My best friend and I want to make it to the tiny house, a yearly thing!
We can't thank you enough for letting us stay in your charming house and for you being so nice and sweet to us!"

We did have a situation where it was unexpectedly hot on our arrival day, and the AC unit was missing. But Kristin got back to me immediately, and they came and reinstalled it right away. They were great hosts!"

She was a wonderful host and thoughtfully provided us with a unique code for the door (changed after every stay) so we would remember it easily! The kitchen was stocked with essentials like oil, spices, pans, etc., which was a nice extra touch. Everything was incredibly clean and organized and we felt like we had a very secluded and private space to enjoy our night in. The next morning, we loved feeding the goats and llama while enjoying coffee provided by Kristen. For other people who are hiking in the area, it was a super easy drive to Mt St Helens. Kristen kindly provided us with some recommendations of other great hikes in the area. Cannot recommend this spot enough!"

Stayed one night","This place deserves more stars for so many reasons. This for me is what Air BnB is all about. Getting to experience an adventure like a tiny home on a working farm that I just don't get in my city life. Here are the reasons you need to book Kristin's place because soon this location will be sold out and the price will have to go up.
1. A tiny house experience that is not short on comfort. Full size fridge, shower and queen size bed.
2. A tranquil setting with endless views of the Columbia River. In short peace and quiet without other humans.
3. A chance to feed the goats and llama. A farm experience 20 feet away if you want it.
4. A great host in Kristin who goes above and beyond. The farm fresh eggs and welcome treats were the icing on the cake.
5. An outdoor camping experience with the tiny house comforts just 10 feet away. A canopy with chairs facing the fire pit and the river plus a hammock for an afternoon snooze after a day of hiking."

It was nice to be able to comfortably cook dinner in the kitchen - loved the ample counter space. And the placement of the bathroom and bedroom at each end meant we weren't having to walk through one to get to the other. Everything was very clean and well maintained, including the super comfortable bed.
The outdoor spaces are so peaceful, with an amazing view and plenty of options for relaxing. We got lucky and had goats around for both dinner and breakfast.
Kristin and Matt were great hosts, providing plenty of info to help our check-in go smoothly and making sure we were comfortable and had everything we need for a great stay. We highly recommend their tiny house!"

I had very good communications with Kristin from day one I made the booking and she was helpful the entire time! the tiny house itself is full of characters (which I recommend you reading the story behind the tiny house on a booklet in the bedroom). Sadly I never got the chance to hang out with the goats and llamas because they normally hang out near the house in the late afternoons (I got in after dark). Maybe next time!! Thank you Kristin!
