We were in town for a dance competition at Opryland Event Center and this location was only 9 mins away and very easy to get back and forth and close to stores and restaurants. We loved the shower, giant mirrors for getting ready, and the retro decorations on the bookshelf. Childhood memories unlocked."

Stayed a few nights","Larry is a great communicator. He responded to all my questions and when I told him I’d be going direct to my conference because I was in very early He allowed me to drop my bags prior to check in time. He met me and showed me how to open door and gave me a remote for the gate. He really made things easy for me. I would recommend this place if you have a conference at the Gaylord. Half way between Airport and Convention center. Everywhere I needed to go was 10 minutes away.
Downtown is a little further but worth going!"

We appreciated the mini fridge for storing some drinks and snacks and our daughter loved the treat of watching the most giant TV I have ever seen from our bed! There was plenty of room to set up a cot for her, too.
We bumped into Larry and he was very friendly as well :)
Also, I appreciated that there were plenty of towels in the bathroom!"

The room was very nice and cozy! Upon entering, we were greeted with complimentary donuts from Larry, very thoughtful!

The location is great for peace and quiet and close to a lot of amenities. Larry was great with clear instructions for getting in and setting up, before we arrived. Larry also went above and beyond to ensure we had a great stay. We will definitely try to book here again when we're back. Thanks Larry!"

Larry was super responsive and very clear in his communication, helping me plan my short visit and download the app for the gate. (The gate app is slightly tricky, but Larry hooked me up with the secret: you have to wait until the icon goes white until you can open/close the gate.) Room is a combination of modern and old-school: bathroom is newly renovated, and there’s a working lava lamp, Zeppelin 8-tracks, a calculator, and a rotary phone. Hosts are cool."

Only a 20 minute drive from the venue, it was located in a more quiet neighborhood, but right off the beaten path of restaurants and shopping. The place was clean, accommodating to our needs, and we felt very secure with cameras and a gated driveway that we had full access to come and go as we pleased. Larry communicated very well and quickly answered any questions I had. We were comfortable and would definitely stay there again. Thank you Larry for opening your space to us!"

Stayed a few nights","Exactly as advertised :) The bathroom felt newly updated and had a rain feature in the shower. There is a thin pocket door seperating the bathroom from the room.
The framed puzzles and colorful decor felt like staying in a friend's guest suite.
We enjoyed the complimentary water and tea/coffee kcup station and watching a movie on the huge tv.
The gate remote app was easy to use, but it was nice having a physical clicker just in case. The driveway is a bit of an incline, so don't let your wheeled luggage get away from you like we did - lol - when unloading our bags to take inside :)
I believe the host lives above, but we heard very little movement. Only sounds seemed to be from the water system when our sink/shower/toilet were in use.
Lastly, the Air Conditioning was FANTASTIC ❣"

There is an additional privacy fence around the backyard that encompasses entrance and parking area, so, not that you need it in such a nice area, but there is that added layer of security. Larry was quick to answer any questions, great communication. Highly recommended"

Stayed with kids","What a perfect spot. We needed a spot in Nashville but didn't want to be right in the city as we have a family, but this was so close and away from the hustle of the city. We only were there to sleep and woke up early the next morning to go spend the morning in Nashville but every ounce of our stay was perfect. Larry went above and beyond to check on us on our way, gave easy but precise directions, and even set up the sleeper for us since we came in so late. Was nice to have waters available after a 14 hour drive. So clean. Under 15 minutes to downtown Nashville. Safe neighborhood. comfy beds. This will be our first choice if we're ever in the area again. So much better than a hotel. Love the host."

I booked Larry’s place while driving from Bozeman, MT to the Carolina’s with a car full of all of my belongings and my bike on the back. I felt such ease with the gated driveway, and the place was quiet and relaxing, allowing me to get some work done.
The space is also close to some greenways, and I had such a great bike ride from his house, past the Titans stadium, and to downtown. Great location!"

Stayed one night","Larry's apartment is at the bottom of his home in a very quiet neighborhood. The off-street, gated parking is an unusual and valuable amenity, especially in a big city like Nashville. The apartment is spotlessly clean and decorated with so many interesting relics, antiques and impressive puzzles Larry's done himself! It is so clear that he has invested a great deal of thought, creativity, and care into this classy little abode. It is cozy but didn't feel cramped. (I was traveling alone but imagine no more than two people who are comfortable sharing a space would be happy here.) As others have said, I appreciated it being out of the chaos of the city of Nashville. I found it to be very quiet and didn't hear anyone above. Overall a good experience and a unique place to stay. I would definitely stay here again!"

The area was a very nice quiet neighborhood, and while the house is shared the only noise from the rest of the house was minimal and only noticeable in the bathroom. The decor inside made it feel very homey, and there were nice little touches like complementary water bottles and a coffee maker right in the room. All of this was also at an amazing price, definitely cheaper than any hotels we looked at! We had a great experience and would absolutely stay here again!"

It was a perfect surprise when we arrived even got her a cake and flowers! That I didn’t expect but wow it was so thoughtful! He was super nice anything I needed very accommodating. I wish there were more host like this. I own my own airbnb and it’s nice to know that there are other people who take pride in their home and are great host. Location was great! 13 min from airport 5 min from mall and 15 for the strip! Basically this was the perfect everything! Book this place you won’t go wrong !!! Thank you so much Larry!! I can’t say enough good things about you and how welcomed you made us feel! Appreciate you a ton!!!! Until next time!

The keypad was easy to use, but the door was little hard to close and there was no deadbolt. The temperature control system was adjustable on the first night, but on the second night the system was set to “manual” and we couldn’t adjust the temperature. Overall, we would stay at this Airbnb again!"

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Larry and Charmaine’s place for 5 nights. The location was great for our needs and early morning flight. We were at the airport in 10 minutes!
His place was spotless and charming. The bed was comfortable and linens were nice.
When the weather in the area got a little wild (tornado warning), Larry checked to make sure we were comfortable and brought us candles. He reassured us and we honestly felt very safe.
The stay was VERY relaxing. The area around the home is quiet. Very little street noise. Although this is in the lower, separate part of the occupied home, we didn’t notice any noise at all.
I can’t think of a single thing that would have made this stay any better. We will be back next time we are in town!"

Stayed a few nights","Awesome eclectic unit. There are some amazing neat little finds within Larry’s place. Very responsive, helpful host. Quiet safe neighborhood. Downloading the gate app and usage of that worked perfectly. Spacious, modern and well laid out room. Short Uber ride to things nearby. 15 min ride to Broadway. Totally recommendable! Thx Larry!"

Stayed a few nights","Excellent single room, studio-type of room, and was larger than I initially anticipated. It was extremely close to the main attractions and felt very safe and comfortable. I felt even more secure than expected, since the entire property was surrounded by a high wood fence and remote controlled gate and a security code that's specific for my visit. The host was awesome in supplying all linens, toiletries, coffee, and even water bottles. It really felt like home away from home! The host was an excellent communicator for questions, even when I arrived late in the evening."

Stayed a few nights","I was in Nashville to visit my daughter attending college at Lipscomb University and found this place to be in just the right location. Away from the hubub (peaceful open spaces), but freeway and main roads made the airport, downtown, and the college easy to get to ~ everything we wanted to do was within 20 minutes or less of a drive. Decor is really fun, the bed & blankets are super comfortable, plush towels are in the bath, bean bag-couch- and work table gave great options for relaxing, reading, TV, or getting some work done. Super clean. Easy place to relax after being out all day. Larry responds quickly and kindly to your communications to him. Would stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","Larry's place is very clean, tastefully decorated, and the bed is very comfortable. My friend thought of putting the couch cushions UNDER the hideabed mattress which made it more comfortable too.
Larry went above and beyond to help us feel comfortable and welcome by making himself available to give each of us coaching on how to operate the gate and by giving me a pair of scissors when I needed it most.
The neighborhood seems extremely safe and country-like but only 10 minutes from the airport and 7 minutes from the Gaylord Opryland Resort Conference center. A wonderful find.
Somehow, I did not gather from the pictures (my perception, not their fault) that it is a single room and bathroom. If both beds are used, they are nearly touching. Worked out fine for us, yet worth noting.
Plenty of clean towels and very tidy and well-appointed bathroom and office area with a coffee spot and fridge. Very cute!"

Loved the shower set up. WiFi worked great. Cozy and comfy. We’re worried up front about noise with this being a private room in a house but didn’t hear anything from outside our room. It was a great location as well with a short drive into the town for dinner and fun.

The feel of the AirBnb is very cozy and like a home away from home. It was very clean and nice. The bathroom is great. It is a roomy space for two people! It is very private which I loved! I also felt very safe here. If you’re traveling alone and worried about feeling safe I highly recommend this stay! Larry was also very kind and helpful.

We were traveling by public transport. About 20 minutes walk to the stop (buses come on time and it is cheap) In the area of the bus stop you will also find supermarkets and a vegan restaurant (Sunflower Bakery)
I'd recommend it to anyone looking to stay in Nashville. The value for money is very well 👍🏼"

We did not use any of the building amenities so I can't speak to those. Elevators can be a bit confusing till you figure them out. All in all we had a great time in Nashville and would stay here again!

She gave us some pointers on where and how to get around. She really helped so much making the trip easy and painless with travel. I explained we had a late flight she accommodated us by informing us about leaving the baggage with the bellhop of the building.
If we ever do come back to Nash, we will definitely go to her again!"

Jamilliah made it feel like home! I always over pack but had we forgotten something we would have been covered because she had it all! The grounds are nice, loved the courtyard! If we visit Nashville again i dont think i would want to stay anywhere else! Huge thanks to Jamilliah for making our stay easy and memorable ❤️"

We were 2 blocks from Broadway and were able to explore Nashville, hit the bars, and go to and from Nissan Stadium without ever needing to call an Uber or drive. The AirBnb photos perfectly matched the studio apartment, and Jamilliah was the best host. Prior to our arrival, she sent us all of the necessary instructions for parking, accessing the building, and navigating the building. We truly enjoyed our stay! Thank you!!"

Jamilliah checked in with me regularly and sent photos and demos of how to check in and use the Latch app. It ended up being very easy. The building accommodates many air bnb guests so there are other services, like a bell hop for luggage storage in the lobby (for a fee). The room itself was very comfortable and quiet. Overall a great stay and a wonderful host!"

Stayed a few nights","Pros:
- Amazing location.
- Price.
- The pool, gym, and lobby are all great and the bed in the room is very comfortable. AC/Heater
Cons:
- Had an oven but no cookware. Had a washer and dryer but no detergent. Hand soap empty. 3 hangers in total. 1 pot and 1 pan. I had 4 prepackaged snacks compared to others receiving wine and fruit. There is no private work space that aligns with airbnbs defn.
- There is mold on the shower curtain and a bunch of half used products in the bathroom. There’s also messy/spilt/uncapped cleaning products filling the cabinets.
- No windows, gets stuffy
- You have to pay to leave bags in the lobby, NOT disclosed here.
- Very loud upstairs neighbor, some party goers
- Messy closet (not like pic)
I also felt the host could’ve been more helpful to me. She was unprepared for my arrival, couldn’t help me mail a package to the apartment and did not check in unless I reached out 1st aside from Latch probs. Good for short stay but inaccurate expectations set."

Stayed a few nights","Overall our stay was very, very good. Jamilliah was always available to answer any questions and met us when we arrived to explain everything. 100% attentive and responsive!!!!
Our only negative feedback is that it was apparent someone lives there full-time and left for our stay. The bathroom had many, many personal items on the counter, the vanity had stuff in the drawers and in the cabinet underneath. The shower had personal items in it as well. The shower curtain had mold stains that form when the curtain is closed and wet. We made the best of it and had a great time. We couldn't ask for a better host. I left my cosmetic back on a shelf in the bathroom, notified her and she mailed it to me the next day.
So again, she was great to work with!"

Stayed a few nights",This place is great for a crash pad. Only thing is it wasn’t super clean. Like there was no soap in the bathroom and there were stains on the kitchen countertop. Also the TV just would not connect to the wifi provided so you’re not able to use that at all. The other issue is the check in. You have to download a certain app and then she sends you a link that allows you access to the building through the app. I have an iPhone and the link simply just did not work for me. Thankfully it worked for my boyfriend but if you aren’t able to get the app to work then you’re S. O. L. Also if you have a Samsung the app isn’t available on there. Lastly if your flight were to arrive prior to your check in time the buildings can hold your bags for 5$ a bag. That just left a bad taste in my mouth. Next time I visit the area I would splurge on something a little nicer to avoid these issues in the future.

Stayed a few nights","This condo was perfect for my husband and I. We loved the location- an easy walk to Broadway (approximately six blocks). We especially appreciated the security in parking and safety of the complex. The condo was clean, nicely decorated, and had everything we needed, Jamilliah met us at check in and was very helpful in explaining the parking and condo access process. We hope to stay here again"

The bed is only a double bed but it is VERY comfortable!!

The apartment itself wasn't as clean as I would have expected, dirty dishes in the dishwasher, old coffee grounds in the coffee maker, and vents caked in dust. The window is facing a parking garage, and was missing a curtain panel so the light was coming in. Jamilliah had a panel for it but maintenance hadn't come to hang it. Luckily we were able to get it hung ourselves so we could block the parking garage light and sleep."

It was a blessing to have such a nice place to stay while we were in Nashville. The host has everything you need plus more inside of the suite. The beds were extremely comfortable and there were plenty of extra blankets and pillows. The complex is extremely secure and the parking garage was very easy to access. The gym was two stories and never busy. The pool is right outside of this condo which made for a great people watching. If you were thinking of staying in Nashville, this is the place just book it now and thank me later. 🩷"

Didn’t really get the chance to cross paths with the owners, but they seemed like they would’ve been friendly and welcoming if you were inclined to interact with them, but they also allow you to have your privacy if that’s what you prefer."

Stayed a few nights","Jon’s place is great. East Nashville is an excellent part of town with lots to offer and easy access to the bus (we used it a lot, very easy). The loft is very cute and exactly like the photos. It is set up very well. I would give 5 stars for this place in a heartbeat except the kitchen sink had an issue so we tried not to use it (not Jon’s fault, it happens) so it made it a little difficult. He was going to get it fixed right away, so that shouldn’t be a concern for anyone. The construction next door was a little noisy at times, but that’s also temporary (and not Jon’s fault). So overall, the place is great and worth the stay.
One really important note… bring a sleep mask. The skylight above the bed and the window allow a lot of light in, so if you are not planning to wake up at sunrise, you might want to plan ahead."

Stayed a few nights","Place is really nice and pretty comfortable. Jon was very responsive to any communication, especially when we first had trouble getting in with the combination.
I would suggest a large doormat on the inside of the door downstairs to wipe off mud and leaves from shoes before going up into the loft.
Also, in the bathroom, I didn't have any room to put my toiletries out - toothpaste and toothbrush, face creams, etc. Maybe a little table right next to the sink?
We really didn't use the kitchen except for making coffee in the Keurig, but if we had, I feel like I would have liked to have some foil and plastic wrap, and also some sponges for wiping down both kitchen and bathroom sinks.
All in all, a really good stay. Thank you!

Stayed a few nights","This place was perfect for my friend and I meeting up from different cities to have a little fun girls weekend catch up while visiting another friend who currently lives in Nashville.
The place was perfect size for two adults in an ideal location!
Jon was super responsive w all questions we had. He made a handful of great suggestions to consider on outings. Seeing his pups in the window as we came and went was a treat!
I would definitely stay here again.
My only suggestion would be to pack light! Dragging my suitcase to back of house over gravel and then upstairs after a long late night flight was not the workout I was expecting."

Stayed a few nights","Jon's Loft was a really nice place to stay. It's cool how it has a rustic feel, it's very private and very quiet. I couldn't even tell we were staying in the city. The location is great, and we were able to walk to lots of places nearby for food, shopping, etc. Jon put together a very informative ""House Manual"" that was probably the best I've seen anywhere I've stayed. Jon was helpful with questions I had about getting around Nashville and it easier for my son and I to explore what the city has to offer. All in all, it is a nice, quiet, convenient place to stay, and I would gladly stay there again if Jon will have us."

Stayed a few nights","If you’re planning a trip to Nashville this is definitely the place to stay. The loft is super cozy and beautifully decorated. I loved the shower area and how spacious it was. The bed was honestly my favorite part because it was incredibly comfortable. This place is also located in such a perfect area. It’s walking distance to the Five Points area and we had the best time walking down there at night and heading to some of their great bars. It’s also very close to downtown so Uber rides there and back were very short and cheap. The host was friendly and super helpful, he responded to messages right away. Overall, I highly recommend anyone who’s considering to stay here! You’re going to love it!"

The neighborhood was calm and relaxing which was a great contrast to the buzzing city. Restaurants in walking distance or a quick drive to downtown Nashville. I loved their touch of the guest book to leave a little note and their map for past guests to leave a pin where they’re from. All around great trip. Thank you!

All the murals. Nashville is such a fun town, so it is hard to go wrong, but being so close to Gallatin Pike makes this spot perfect in our book."

Fairly clean, the place could use a really good dusting and the bathroom floor a really good scrubbing. The bathroom floor in the shower area and around the toilet were pretty nasty. However the worse part was the mattress which needs to be replaced, the mattress has completely collapsed in the middle, so needless to say left with a very sore back."

Stayed a few nights","We loved the place! the HVAC works very well (it's a relativey small place), the location is great. just a 10-15 minute walk to some great restaurants and if you're there on a weekend, parking is no problem -there is a school across the street so that would be a challenge during the school week.
The bathroom is AWESOME. simple and clean.
The water heater worked great!
the gate going to the loft is warped and does not latch, let alone close at all, so that was a bit odd.
We heard Zero noises from neighbors or anything out of the ordinary so it was peaceful and quiet.
Also don't expect to sleep in. The skylights let you know when the sun is up.
It was very clean and well-kept when we arrived.
we enjoyed our stay, and hopefully you do to!"

Nice private clean accommodation’s with a well stocked kitchenette and tv. The Airbnb is at the back behind Jon’s home so they are close if you have a need. There is a short flight of stairs and is only accessible down a side walkway and gravel path that may be a little challenging to someone with mobility issues or wheeling a large suitcase but Other than that it was very comfortable and we enjoyed the informal decor that fits with the Five Points climate. We’ll definitely come back.

The location is absolutely perfect and near so many restaurants, eateries, and some really cute shops we found on our last day. Excellent and friendly neighborhood. We felt safe, comfortable, and private. Short Uber ride to downtown as well as other locations. We had no issues during our time there but Jon and Amanda would always remind us to reach out if we needed anything at all, whenever we ran into them. Apartment was super cute and comfortable enough for just us two. Everything worked well and check in was super easy. Only recommendations we have is that the couch should definitely be replaced as it stained on one side and is uncomfortable where the cushions constantly slide out. Also, the path to the loft can be uncomfortable to navigate especially if wearing heels or carrying heavy luggage as it cannot be rolled in. These were not deal breakers for us. A new couch and a better path to the loft and this can easily be one of the best Airbnbs in East Nashville! We recommend this place and would definitely stay again! Thanks again Jon and Amanda!"

It was not terrible, just some extra cleaning to make it A+.

Stayed a few nights","I made several recommendations upon checking out. The hosts left great info, recommendations, and directions upon arrival.
The cleanliness of the place was an issue for us though. There was gravel all over the entry way upon arrival and the walls were visibly dirty throughout. The floor is “rustic” I would say, which is fine if you’re going to regularly vacuum it since it cannot be swept. Any clothes laid of the floor were immediately covered in dust bunnies and the fans, window sills, etc. were also very dusty. A nightmare for those of us with severe allergies. There were stains on the living room furniture and ant issues throughout the place. I would not voluntarily shower without shoes, since the bathroom tile/grout was gross as well.
The one positive to this place is the price and location. I think it could really be a great place if there was more attention to detail. Lots of amazing food and drinking spots in East Nashville (Five Points Pizza, Edley’s BBQ, & Red Door Saloon) and just a short Uber ride to Broadway/downtown Nashville. Also, the hosts did take note of us visiting for our anniversary and left a bottle of champagne for us.
Overall, the positives just didn’t outweigh the cleanliness issues for us so we will not be coming back."

The kitchen appliances were very convenient and the shower was also nice. We felt very safe, welcome, and at home, while also having as much privacy as we wanted. Thank you very much Jon!!!"

I felt we were central to the different parts of town, no where was more then a 10 min Uber. The loft was also supplied with amble blankets which I loved! The host family was extremely kind and sweet! Would love to stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Based on the reviews, we thought this would be a perfect place to stay during our trip in Nashville. I will say that the host is AWESOME! Jon responded to my messages very quickly and was very helpful.
I would say the cleanliness was the biggest issue. When we walked in, we immediately noticed a funky smell. Almost like old, wet wood, and that is kind of just the smell that the place has. The towels also didn’t really smell clean. We also had an ant infestation at one point and this seems to be a common issue as there were ant traps all over the place in the loft. We did let the host know about this and he said he was going to get an exterminator over there after we left, so at least there’s that.
Another issue was the door. The door didn’t lock when we left. We had to enter a code to get in initially but then when we left, we were instructed to lock the door from the inside and then close it and it would lock, but each time we returned to the loft we could get in by just trying the handle on the door.
The bed was very loud, but I thought comfortable. It’s a very soft mattress, so if you have back problems, it might be too soft for your needs.
Lastly, there are dogs that bark at you on either side of the fence when you walk down the path to enter the loft.
As I mentioned, the host of this place was great, but unfortunately the loft was what we expected, and we wished we would’ve opted for a hotel for this trip. :("

Stayed a few nights",Location was our favorite part of this experience! So close to dozens of nice places. Great for exploring the city of Nashville. Not the cleanest place we’ve stayed- there were ants in the bathroom and the sheets were a little dirty. Also the skylight in the bedroom made it hard to sleep later than 7am. The worst part of the entire stay was that we got terrorized by dogs on both sides of the pathway every time we leave and enter the loft.

Stayed a few nights","Great location and a cute little space. We had originally planned on having 4 people stay here (which the listing said it could handle) but at the last minute only 2 of us could make it. I’m glad this happened because we could not have fit 4 adults in this space comfortably for a week. It was perfect for two people, would have been ok for three people, but four people is just unrealistic for any extended period of time in my opinion.
Overall a very positive stay and we had a great time in Nashville. Check in/out was easy and flexible and we loved having a kitchen so that we didn’t need to eat out all the time. Ubering into town was almost always less than $10"

Stayed a few nights","You seriously can't beat the location. Parking was never an issue. My stay was mid-January and a winter storm blew in, but the loft was warm and peaceful.
This is definitely a place for solo travelers, two best friends or a couple. Very intimate with the open layout and frosted bathroom door.
For people who are light sleepers, I'd suggest bringing an eye mask since there's a skylight directly above the bed. Also, for people with back problems, the mattress is very soft.
I will 100% suggest this place to friends and family."

Stayed a few nights","What a great stay in East Nashville! As a solo female traveler flying in, my top priority was feeling safe, but also feeling close enough to explore while walking, and this was the perfect spot. This loft is nestled in a residential area, in an optimal location to great coffee shops, restaurants, shops, and is a cheap Uber ride over to downtown Nashville. The loft itself was cozy and restful-- it even had everything I needed to cook a few meals while there.
In addition, Jon and his family were super kind and hospitable each time I encountered them during my stay.
If you're looking to explore Nashville with a more low-key and mellow approach, I can't recommend East Nash and this loft enough."

There's also plenty of restaurants, bars, and shops within a 10-minute drive from the loft. Overall, a great location in an area of the city that has a local feel, but is still close to everything you could need."

Stayed a few nights","We thought this was a great find in Five Points. Lots to do within walking distance, and easy, quick access to downtown or the airport. The space was very, very nice. You might want to bring a sleeping mask because of the skylights if you're not a morning person, but Jon has a special space here. We hope to come back again. And their Halloween decorations in the yard were excellent. But do yourself a favor and read the instructions for how to get into the Loft before you arrive. Don't do as we did and walk into the house unexpected. (Not that it was a problem for Jon's family or dogs, but we felt quite embarrassed)."

Stayed a few nights","First- this place is a gem for location! What a great neighborhood just minutes from downtown Nashville. Jon responded right away when we texted that we needed the bathroom cleaned again due to many long black hairs found through the bathroom! Overall we were happy with the loft and the value was good for the money. A couple of things that need to be taken care of in our opinion are- a new mattress! Our sleep wasn’t great because the mattress makes you roll to the middle ! Another issue is that the hosts/owners have 3 dogs and the neighbors have a dog and they all come to the gate you go through to get to the loft and bark at you! The hosts dogs get up on the steps of the porch and are at face height and braking and the neighbors fence has holes in it so that their dog can put his head through the holes , at ankle height and bark. So you have 4 dogs that , if you wanted to touch that’s how close they are! If the hosts just put a taller fence, even at the steps, so the dogs aren’t greeting you at your face that would at least be better! We got a laugh out of the house rules that said to please be quiet when walking through the pathway because they like their neighbors and don’t want to disturb them! The four dogs barking are enough to disturb anyone !"

Stayed a few nights","The unit is as advertised. Nice little apartment above the garage. Easy to get in and out of, safe neighborhood, GREAT location.
The Friday evening I stayed there, the owners had a pool party that evening that went well into the night. Once it got dark outside the party moved to the garage or whatever is on the ground level which seemingly was directly below the bedroom and I was unable to sleep. It was very loud, rowdy, and reminiscent of my college days renting an apartment on campus. If my partner had been with me we would have put serious thought into leaving, but because I was a solo traveler and the door was deadbolted, I felt a higher degree of confidence that nothing too bad would happen.
Future travelers should take that into consideration, but I believe it would probably be a one-off.
A few notes future travelers should be aware of:
- there is 1 primary window near the office nook, at the top of the stairs, and it does it have a blind/curtain. It looks directly over the owners back yard, into their house, etc. I did not like that feeling so I hung up my own blind.
- I did not feel that the lock on the door knob was the most secure (an intruder could probably force the door open with little resistance), so any traveler should deadbolt when they can
- there is no shower curtain. Not a problem for me, but can see how it may not be the most ideal for others.
- the skylights are great, but the one in the bedroom is directly above the bed, meaning you may be waking up with the sun."

It was very thoughtfully decorated and had everything one needed if wanting to stay for an extended period of time as well. Bed was excellent and there was absolutely no noise other than the A/C - but it was the white noise that people like! We had a great stay."

Stayed a few nights","Nice small space, looked as described. It fit my needs for the time I was there. The bed was very comfortable (sometimes I end up hurting after waking in a different bed then my own but I did not in this bed). The full size fridge was nice, and a stand up shower. I wish I would have brought house shoes to wear since the floor is slab and my feet froze when I walked around, so remember your house shoes or extra socks!
My only complaints would be: the door that sticks which made coming and going burdensome, especially when unloading and loading the car; unfortunately the couch was not comfortable at all, it looked nice in the space but I could not get comfortable and ended up using the bed as a couch; lastly the cost was pricey, I paid $705 for 3 nights (usually at this price point you get a lot of ‘wow’ moments for extra attention to detail, etc).
Overall the space fit my needs for the short time I was there. If you need a small clean space on your travels then this will work for you!"

And the location was perfect! Super convenient for any where you would like to go. Longest travel time I drove was 15min. They helped me out with the weird weather TN was having while I was there and allowed me to ask any questions I had. They made my stay stress free and I can not thank them enough! Side note, the bed is TO DIE FOR! SUPER comfy! I do not know where they got it but I would love to, it was simply amazing! Thank you for this opportunity to stay in your gorgeous home!"

The essential oil diffuser and white noise machine were nice touches. The only thing I overlooked in the photos is that there aren't any windows besides the ones in the door. This didn't matter too much for me since I was in Nashville for a conference and gone a lot. I was looking for a quiet, comfortable place to come back to each night, and this place delivered! A safe, tree-lined neighborhood that’s close to restaurants and Trader Joe’s. It took less than 20 minutes to get downtown and cost around $20 via Lyft."

We heard some footsteps from the owners upstairs but it was never bothersome, just something to note. Everything that we needed was included, from shampoo to cookware. We stayed for 5 nights and could have used an extra towel or two- 3 were provided, which is more than enough for shorter stays, but guests staying longer may want to bring a few extras. The space was beautiful and relaxing, which was exactly what we were hoping for in contrast to the bustle of downtown. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and allowed us to have a restful visit. Jack and Rachel were very unobtrusive but available and helpful with anything we needed. I would absolutely recommend this stay for anyone in the Nashville area that is looking to have a peaceful trip!"

Although it was all one room, it was super spacious for my husband, me, and our 2 month old baby. Speaking of which, Rachel and Jack even got our son a toy to play with and to take home! It was so thoughtful and really helped put us (new parents) at ease about our first trip with him. I also appreciated the body wash, shampoo, and conditioner because I definitely forgot mine. It was a great experience and we will no doubt be back!"

We had everything that we needed. The bed and furniture was clean & comfortable. The bath towels were very nice and the shower had great water pressure. We were a quick Uber ride away from Broadway and everything else happening in the city. There were some businesses in the building downstairs so I took advantage of the nail salon and had a really nice pedicure. Overall this was a great place to stay, I'd love to come back and Jimmy is a fantastic host. He was responsive to a multitude of questions on the first day of our stay and gave great recommendations on things to do and places to go in the area. Also, Instacart was easy to order while we were there and the building was quiet and peaceful."

I only stayed 1 night but would def stay again bc of the great location & quaint style of his place! Def recommend! I did have a a tiny bit of trouble with opening the door but Jimmy told me so many ppl do, you just have to turn the key & push! It got easier after the second time haha Thanks again Jimmy!! :)"

Stayed a few nights","We had a fabulous three-night stay in Nashville at Jimmy’s place. It was an ideal location, five minutes by car to the downtown. We loved the neighborhood in and of itself - we walked a lot and we really enjoyed Barcelona Wine Bar, BarTaco, 8th & Roast Coffee Shop, and Five Daughters Bakery. Downtown, we parked in the lot between the Farmers Market and the Tennessee State Museum. We visited both, and that parking lot has no time limit so we just left our car there and walked to other downtown sights. We had an amazing dinner at the Mockingbird, and we stopped by one of the downtown hotels and got the number to enter the Red Phone Booth. That was a treat. Jimmy could not have been any nicer or a better communicator. The space is filled with natural light, and I loved his styling. We did a lot of sightseeing during our stay, and it was great to “go home” to such a relaxing and beautiful space."

The bed was very comfortable and extra blanket was provided. The living room was comfortable and the TV viewing excellent. The bathroom and shower were top notch. I appreciated having an upscale environment to enjoy that was quiet and because I was traveling alone I truly felt safe in this building. Below was a great place to have a bite and get some great coffee and down the road I could walk to get dinner. This was my first visit to Nashville, a birthday weekend, and Jimmy's place was exactly what I needed to be centrally located and able to meet up with my friends."

Stayed a few nights","The condo is just steps away from a Publix, a Liquor store, a cute Mexican restaurant with great margaritas...go for the big one or go home...and the ""must try"" Hattie's B's. I highly recommend ML Rose for great beers and burgers. We ubered our way into Nashville's museums and down to Broadway - all minutes away. Loser's Bar was a great stop with a great band playing but honestly, you can't go wrong anywhere downtown. There's so much going on. For a real Nashville experience I recommend The Listening Room, it was the highlight for us, there was nothing that compared to hearing artists perform their own material in an intimate setting. We had hoped to make it to the Bluebird Cafe for a similar experience but it was sold out during our stay. We'll be back for a Nascar race or Predators game! The condo itself was clean, equipped, quiet, and comfy. The perfect place for the 2 of us. Jimmy was very accomodating and easy to communicate with. Thanks so much for hosting us."

No steps to haul luggage up! We've stayed in just about every 1 bed-room airbnb in the 12 South vicinity (we have family nearby), and this is our favorite. We also want to add that Jimmy is an exceptional host: We made an error in our reservation which we only discovered at the last minute. Jimmy dropped what he was doing to make sure the problem got resolved. It saved us a lot of scrambling and stress. We are really appreciative. Needless to say, we've already booked another stay here!
P.S. Check out the almond croissants at the Little Gourmand in the tiny shopping center directly across the street. We're addicted!"

First off, the location is absolutely fantastic if you don't want to be in the center of the riff raff. The Melrose / Berry Hill area is perfect if you want to escape to a quieter area after a full days experience. Jimmy's condo is just a mile or two from South Broadway, 12 South, and the Gulch, which made it absolutely perfect! Melrose is also a fun area with plenty of restaurants and nice neighborhoods to walk or run. The condo itself was extremely nice. Jimmy has it decorated beautifully and it has all the modern amenities you need. The bed is exceptionally comfortable as is the rest of the furnishings. Parking was included and getting in and out of the building was a cinch. If you're visiting Nashville I would definitely recommend Jimmy's condo. We will definitely be staying here again!"

The space was clean, the bed was very comfortable and you have everything you need! We made a few meals and were even able to do a load of laundry. The living room area is also great to just kick and relax. Would love to visit again - Jimmy is a great host and excellent communicator"

Stayed over a week","We've stayed in one-bedroom apts all over the 12 South and Music Row area in the past 3 years and Jimmy's is one of our favorites. We were here for 3 weeks. The apartment is spotlessly clean, quiet, spacious; the kitchen is well equipped, it's very comfortable and pleasantly decorated, and everything works as it should. It's an easy walk to shops, the Publix, etc...and behind you is the 8S/12S residential neighborhood, which is nice for walking. This is a 'junior executive' one bedroom, which means that one bedroom wall is a partial wall so if you are light sensitive, eyeshades will take care of it. For an apartment, it's extremely quiet - you cannot hear any traffic noise from adjoining 8S because the apartment faces the back of the building (more than making up for the view over the parking lot). There are big windows and lots of natural light since the apartment is on the fourth floor. There is a designated parking spot.
Jimmy was also very quick to respond to emails and provided 2 key fobs. Needless to say, we would be delighted to return."

Stayed a few nights","Fabulous place! We Uber downtown and it cost $7 one way. Plus having parking, it’s a 20 min drive to the Opry. The complaint about the train on here is a joke. We stayed four days, I heard the train twice the whole time there, the only two reason why I heard it, one, I was awake at the time and two, cause I was trying to listen for it. My fiancé didn’t hear it once. The train is off in the distant. I felt very secured staying here, especially with my car. The Airbnb looks over the parking lot. Talked with a few of the neighbors, very friendly people living here."

Stayed with kids","So, gonna get right to it:
Jimmy is a kind, friendly, THOUGHTFUL host.
The unit is VERY quiet and spacious, full if sensible cooking/eating utensils, dish and glass friendly 😊 (everything you would need to cook and enjoy NICE meal)
GOOD hot water and shower pressure (Yes that's important! Lol)
In-unit W/D most helpful to keep things tidy
Excellent heat/cooling. Very comfortable
Beds are very comfortable, lots of pillows, spares (this was comforting after a busy flight)
Lots of instructions BUT, once you read through, you clearly see Jimmy has thought of everything and wants you/your party to have a pleasant stay.
Grocery store walking distance & others not far from the unit.
Just book it. You will be glad you did.
Sidebar: You'll get GREAT photos in this place!"

I have stayed in several Airbnbs and this one was by far the most comfortable. Very safe and secure feeling we will recommend this location to anyone who is coming down to Nashville to visit.

When I arrived to the place it was very easy to find and get inside. The entire space was very clean. When visiting Nashville in the future I would definitely stay at any of Mark’s Airbnbs again.

We don’t mind walking so it was all and all the perfect spot for the short stay we had in Nashville! The apartment itself was no frills, but cozy and the bed was very comfortable."

Stayed a few nights","We actually loved the location. We had our own vehicle but we were able to catch the Hop on Hop off Bus tour at the Belmont Mansion., just a couple of blocks away. We found it easy to get to parking near Broadway....where lots of music and great food can be found. It also was easy driving to get to the Grand Ole Opry and to Centenial Park as we always tell our GPS not to do hwys. The nice part about that is you get to see other areas of the metropolitan area. The location was great as you walk or drive a short distance and park and go by all the famous recording studios. Mark's little apt was perfect to return to rest up in between adventures. We only had 2 days and we feel like having a place away from the crowds was perfect for us."

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay and the location of the place. It’s a cute little bungalow and was the perfect size for the two of us. Quite clean as well.
A great breakfast sandwich place called Egghill is a couple of blocks away and well worth the short walk.(we went there two mornings in a row!) Also, try OSA coffee that’s right around the corner from Egghill. Good stuff!
A couple of drawbacks were the water pressure is very low in the bathroom sink and the water temperature fluctuates a bit in the shower. The couch/sofa bed shown in the pictures does not match what is in the unit. It was confusing to try and set up(and uneven) so we just used the cushions provided for it and put them directly on the floor.
All in all, I would recommend this place and would stay here again."

The place is PERFECT, his personal “guidebook” is entertaining and incredibly thorough and helpful, and he even dropped off a space heater one morning when the forecast called for lower-than average temps. The heat in the apartment works perfectly, but he was concerned anyway and went out of his way to ensure our comfort. Also … he did not randomly show up/knock and give us the heater … he left it by the front door and then called to let us know it was there … that was SO APPRECIATED… as a solo-traveling female I would have been very uncomfortable with a host showing up unannounced … but he respected our privacy and was incredibly thoughtful! He is, BY FAR, the best airbnb host I’ve ever encountered! Will definitely stay in one of his properties again, and I wholeheartedly recommend him!!"

Stayed one night","Mark was really great at communication, positive attitude. But the location of the neighborhood isn’t what I expected , parking was horrendous you either could park in front of the place but it was a consistent one way fast traffic . So getting out and in your car was risky especially trying to get your little ones out. The location was pretty but the neighborhood was loud we weren’t expecting a live band playing behind the complex so hearing heavy music until 11 at night wasn’t exciting . The housekeeper forgot to take out the trash so it made us uncomfortable of what else wasn’t cleaned ! The one thing that made us very uncomfortable was when we had returned for the night we noticed the side door had been unlocked and was cracked open , we never opened or went through it . Scared us ! Also their is always cold air seeping through the whole house , make sure to bring extra socks or warm house shoes. I do want to say though the place is very close to everything bars , restaurants and coffee ! So that was great and the place was very aesthetically pleasing."

Stayed a few nights","This was a wonderful place to stay when visiting Nashville. We wandered to many different areas and hit up some pretty great local spots for eats - walk to Egghill (8 minutes) for a delicious and hearty crafted egg breakfast sandwich! We walked about 10 minutes toward Ruby Sunshine which offered a nice outside eat option for brunch as well. Food was plentiful..tons of options and this brunch spot sits on a really nice shopping street.
The place itself to stay was excellent. Clean and super super quiet. We had incredibly restful sleeps and it was so nice to come back home to a chill and comfortable space after a full day of being out and about with busy crowds and loud music. We appreciated the ability to have a safe storage space for our luggage before and after check in.
We didn’t use the kitchen but it’s quite functional.
Mark and family were very responsive to any questions we had and responded really quickly which was appreciated. Check in and check out was beyond seamless.
I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this place. It was a wonderful stay."

We did not have a car on this trip and so we used Uber and Lyft to commute each day and evening to the downtown area and except for a very busy Saturday night return home, the cost was generally only about $10. We would highly recommend staying at Mark's place when visiting Nashville as it was absolutely perfect for our weekend stay for 3 persons!"

The immaculate and rustic Treehouse had all the amenities you would need to rest, relax and get in touch with nature. From the babbling creek to the tall trees to the farm dog ""Indie"" and the chickens which supplied fresh eggs to enjoy. Taylor and Michaella are fantastic hosts and we are blessed to have an opportunity to stay at this wonderful spot. looking forward to staying again, perhaps in the fall or winter months!"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at the treehouse was idyllic! It's obvious that it was built with care and intention. The surroundings are very peaceful and lush. All the big windows let in a ton of natural light in and the views really made us feel like we were up in the trees. The balcony overlooks the creek below and was a great spot to have our morning tea and appreciate the nature around us. That combined with the hot tub, vinyls, pickleball court, and farm-fresh eggs our first day (nice touch!) made this a perfect stay.
Nashville is a quick 30-minute drive away. Easy to do city things while staying here. We rented a car and that worked well (I don't recommend Uber or Lyft for this location since it's more remote).
Privacy wasn't an issue for us, but if you're looking for total privacy, you may not find it here. The treehouse neighbors the host's cabin and residence. We felt like we had enough privacy to fully enjoy the property. All in all, this was a fantastic Airbnb and I would stay there again."

The hosts are so kind and cool- we had tornado warnings on the way in and they let us hang out with them while the weather passed and gave us some wonderful tea!
Our trip began before our trip and the description helped us with that. We listened to records we brought, we made meals we packed together in a beautiful kitchen surrounded by nature’s beauty through the many windows . We played Baldurs gate together on a saved game with a monitor we brought. (Note: there is not tv and the internet and cell reception are sparse (which is perfect and what we wanted) so for you gamer kids that want to be in nature and spend time together doing something you love- do prepare!)
It was a perfect getaway with serene surroundings. So grateful that such a lovely place exists. 💜"

Stayed one night","The treehouse had a beautifully designed interior. Even though the treehouse is fairly close to a residence and another rental, you really do feel like you’re alone in the woods while inside because of the huge windows facing the woods and the thought-out placement of the treehouse.
We stayed here the night after our wedding and we were looking forward to cooking a meal together and binging our current show. However, we were not able to cook because we could not find a pan to use on the stove top and the oven would trigger the smoke alarm every time we tried to turn it on to pre-heat (even though nothing was in the oven and there was no smell/smoke). We also had to resort to streaming on a phone because the wifi was not usable for streaming on a laptop. We enjoyed our stay here and it was so dreamy and relaxing to look at the windows watching the rain while drinking coffee. We just thought that for the price we paid, it was not acceptable that the wifi and oven/stove were unusable."

Stayed a few nights","This place was absolutely adorable. You can tell a lot of care went into building this treehouse from the wood branch railing, beautiful slate and wood exterior, a ton of windows, so the light was fantastic in there, to the furniture picked out. It was so comfy too. I don’t know what is so special about that bed, but it truly is like you are sleeping in the clouds. The wood burning stove was such a nice touch. Sitting in the jacuzzi in the woods was a really pleasant experience. Kitchen was well appointed for a small space, bathroom was nicely designed and had good amenities, and the fresh eggs from their chickens in the fridge was a major bonus. I loved it. Would recommend! Only thing to note is it isn’t completely private. There is a cabin you can see from the back deck. However, when you are inside it feels private. You will also likely see the family on the property. I only mention this in case you are looking for a treehouse in the woods where no one is within possible sight."

Stayed one night",I surprised my wife with a visit to this incredible cabin for our anniversary . Let’s just say she was more than impressed. The cabin exceeded expectations. We just kept commenting this that felt like we were inside of an architectural digest magazine. There was snow all around us and the hot tub was an awesome experience. There were some plumbing maintenance issues “due to the insanely cold 10 degree weather we were having” upon our arrival but the host and the couple cleaning and working on the issues were so kind and we totally understood so no big deal! They had us in the cabin with only a short delay. The heaters worked wonderful and we were cozy all night. The cabin was exactly 30min from downtown Nashville. We will definitely be back! 10/10

Stayed a few nights","The photos of this gorgeous treehouse did not do it justice! It was impeccably clean and quite literally, something out of a dream. We arrived during a record-breaking cold snap (9 degrees) and the fireplace / ductless split did a solid job of keeping the place warm for the most part (hot water finally froze up on our last day), so I would expect absolutely perfect temperatures inside during any other regular time of the year. This was certainly not the fault of the treehouse hosts but the result of some extreme weather. We enjoyed the farm-fresh eggs and butter very much. The hot tub was wonderful. Snow kept us from venturing out as much as we had intended, but the treehouse was definitely an ideal spot to cozy up in for a couple of days. I would say that we kind of expected the deck and stairs to be shoveled at some point during our stay or for us to be provided a shovel. Overall the loveliest stay and we hope to return in the very near future. We highly recommend this treehouse!"

Stayed a few nights","Taylor and Michaella have a clean, beautiful tree house nestled on their spacious property. The house is truly something out of a movie. Seated on a large piece of land with a steady flowing creek in the back yard, adorable chickens to greet you (and provide delicious eggs), and gorgeous scenery, this house is truly spectacular. To top it all off, our gracious hosts invited us to stay with them due to severe tornados in the area which claimed several peoples lives. In a world full of so much selfishness, Taylor and Michaella went above and beyond to ensure we were safe and taken care of. Will without a doubt be coming back as soon as possible!

We felt removed from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, while being an easy drive to Nashville. The placement of the hottub gave amazing views of the surrounding woodlands. We also love seeing the sweet pup and kitty as well as the chickens who were delightfully free-ranging during the day.
You can tell that the hosts put a lot of thought and care into the construction of the treehouse and furnishings. The master bed is the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. My partner loved the rocking chairs on the porch.
Taylor was a phenomenal host, answering questions promptly, helping with anything we needed, and just a delight to interact with.

The attention to detail within the home is unmatched. Every kitchen utensil, faucet, light fixture, placement of a window was done with intent and it shows. The bedding was sooo comfortable. I believe the sheets and the comforter was linen and the lights beside the bed where on dimmer switches which is helpful for night reading or just being old and not being able to see lol. Love this space and can't say enough about it. oh the farm fresh eggs where a great touch as well"

They thought of everything—a personal welcome note, a notebook full of recommendations, a Brita water filter, snacks, phone chargers, toiletries, and even a flat iron for my hair. The AC kept us cool and the kitchen was well-equipped to fix some of our breakfast meals. The parking permit was a big blessing, too, because 12 South is a very popular shopping and dining area. We come to Nashville several times a year to visit our son and his family so we will definitely try to book Stuart’s place again."

We didn't get a chance to try all of the places, but will definitely stay here again when we're back in the area.

The owners have arranged everything thoughtfully and had enough amenities provided for our two-night stay that we didn't need to shop for things like coffee or soap as with some rentals. We would stay again."

The location cannot be beat- 1 block off the main street in the 12 South neighborhood, with lots of restaurants and shops, but still very quiet. Street parking is limited to residents (they’ll give you a guest pass), so finding a place to park was never an issue. The unit had everything we needed, and laundry access was provided on request. Stuart and Mary were easy to communicate with and very accommodating. The wifi worked well. Would stay here again next time we are in Nashville!"

The location is the best - we needed to be at the fairgrounds every day and it was a 7 minute drive. The private street ensures a parking space, even on the weekends in the evening when the local restaurants are crowded. Great restaurants nearby - walking distance. Kitchen is stocked well with the basics and everything works well. Mattress is on the soft side, but many people will like it and it didn't hamper our sleep. Would highly recommend Stuart's lodging."

Neighborhood was charming and very quiet, yet if you were looking for some night life, food and drinks, it was literally 2 blocks away. The hosts even provided a binder full of restaurant menus, suggestions of things to do, and free maps of Nashville, which was so helpful! Oh, and did I mention, we had the best greeter ever when we arrived? His name is Boots and he's a really friendly kitty 😺

The two beds in the living room are uncomfortable when sitting on for an extended period. Curtains should be hung at the windows and doors. Hard to sleep at night with the light shining in. We enjoyed the complimentary coffee and the place was well kept. Overall enjoyed our stay!"

The place is picked up, but dusty, bathtub caulk is moldy and in general doesn't show evidence of a very deep cleaning between stays. One other note, they don't appear to reset the apps on the tv when guests leave, so make sure you do that so your information isn't there for future guests. All in all, was not a bad experience, but some little details just missing."

Stayed one night",This was the perfect place to stay. Was so thrilled with Rindi’s condo. Felt like a boutique hotel.. Loved the high ceilings. The beds were incredibly comfortable. Big bathroom with huge walk in closet. Great water pressure in the shower. Has a really nice pool and gym & is walking distance to the best restaurants and bars. Rindi was so helpful and answered immediately. A true superhost.

Rindi was super responsive and friendly and we also loved the supply of TP, soap, shampoo, etc…so we didn’t have to buy a ton for just a few days. That’s a big plus!"

Stayed a few nights","I was a little worried when other guests said they got a boot on their car cause of parking. I'm here to tell you that there was no problem finding it! I did do a lap around the building before going to grab the parking pass. I was then easily able to spot the alley where the parking garage was. I even messaged Rindi with a picture of my car and the spot and he quickly responded.
We arrived in the morning and Rindi let us do a early check in! I was extremely grateful for that and it was a life saver. We were right next to the pool which did get loud but that's to be expected. They manage the pool down there so everyone was done swimming by 8pm so it was then quiet.
It's a quick walk to broadway and literally around the corner to ol smoky. My kids loved that the parlor donuts were right when you stepped out the building!
Rindi is an amazing host. So fast to respond, clean place, washer/ dryer and even had things like laundry soap, beer and water in the fridge. 100% would stay again."

The pool is definitely a party area in the summer.
Only complaint was we could hear our neighbors above us stomping late at night but everything else was great. 10/10 would recommend for a bachelor/bachelorette or fun trip."

Group trip",Loved this place! However the parking for guests is very confusing and hard to find. My friend who met us there ended up getting a wheel boot on her car and had to pay $100 to get it removed. She was in the wrong spot. She even asked the people working there where the priority parking was and they didn’t know what she was talking about.

Stayed with kids","Rindi's condo is an absolute gem! Rindi added many extra touches, from the Keurig coffee pods and granola bars, to the cold beer in the refrigerator! There were plenty of extra towels, pillows, blankets, and even washing machine pods. The condo was fully stocked with everything needed during our five day stay. The gym, swimming pool and courtyard were added bonuses! The location is within walking distance to Bridgestone Arena and the famous Honkey Tonk Highway on Broadway. I'm definitely adding this to my list of Air B&B's to visit again! Thank you Rindi, for your Five Star stay!"
