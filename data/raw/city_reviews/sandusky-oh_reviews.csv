Stayed a few nights","The place was exactly how it is described. It worked perfectly for us. I may just rent it out again next year when I come back for graduation…😁Kimberly was a gracious host. The additional snacks and drinks, as well as the coffee, that was provided was extremely generous… very unexpected but definitely appreciated. The bathroom has a toothbrush, as well as other basic items, if you happened to forget something….it’s the little things that stick
out to us and we were very impressed."

Stayed with kids","This home is immaculate, all beds, linens and towels are very comfortable. The home has everything we, a family of 5, needed for our two night stay. The snacks left next to the coffee bar and the drinks in the fridge were very appreciated since our kids had so much fun at Ghostly Manor we missed the opportunity to get to an open grocery store. We cooked breakfast both days and found the kitchen well stocked. Even the washer and dryer was of high quality and Kimberly had laundry pods available — we washed our towels after our trip to Kalahari.
We highly recommend this AirBnB!"

House was very clean and cozy. Beds were very comfortable, and the house was well equipped. Kimberly had snacks and some basic supplies which we appreciated. We cooked dinner and breakfast in the house, it had what we needed to get that all done.
Kimberly was great and helpful for checkin/out."

From the peaceful and stunning decor to the well stocked snack and coffee station! We were amazed by all the careful details! The bathroom and kitchen were well stocked. The beds were comfortable and there was plenty of room for our family of four which includes two teenagers! Kimberly has not left out one detail! The location was perfect! It’s only a few minutes to cedar point and just a few more minutes to downtown Sandusky! We can’t recommend this place enough! Hoping to stay here again next time we visit the area!!!"

Stayed with kids","You will not find another host as accommodating or as thoughtful as Kimberly. She was attentive to every small detail within the home and her extra touches of the grab and go breakfasts, welcoming gifts, beverages, toiletries, etc was not unnoticed. The area may appear as rough to some; however, all of the neighbors and individuals walking down the sidewalk were friendly and courteous. It was 2 blocks away from Cedar Point and some great restaurants. It was the perfect spot for ourselves, our toddler daughter and another couple and baby, too. Thank you so much for being so welcoming and not missing a detail in your home!"

Stayed with kids","We are local and decided to find somewhere within an hour's drive to just get away for the weekend with the kids. Kimberly's place was the perfect find! Everything was spotless, the decor was bright and fresh and it was just a really comfortable place to spend a couple of days.
There are plenty of stores in the area for all of your needs (we even discovered that Sandusky has our beloved Drug Mart!!!). We drove in to the city center where the holiday lighting ceremony on the square was happening and visited the Merry-Go-Round Museum which was super cool. There are so many things to do in the area and we are looking forward to returning in summer for an overnight trip to Cedar Point, which is six minutes away by car.
Kimberly also had beverages for us in the fridge and a ton of snacks/breakfast bars and toiletries like I have not seen before in an Airbnb. The kids (our 11 year-old and her friend) thought the place was ""poppin'"", as they say (insert horrified look from my child)."

She was so detail oriented and truly thought of everything when it came to the guest experience. She had extra shampoos and soaps, toothbrushes, razors, etc. There were drinks in the fridge and a great coffee bar.
Not to mention she left a birthday card and balloon arrangement because she knew we were celebrating a birthday!!

Thank you, Kimberly. I hope everyone has an opportunity to stay here, it is well worth it."

There is a high end washer and dryer with detergent pods which were so nice after a grungy day at the park. There’s a snack drawer and drinks in fridge. There are a few board games in the storage area under the sofa cushion. The stove has a griddle that sits over the burners, perfect for pancakes. Kimberly was super thoughtful and very responsive. A set up like this is just better than staying at a hotel around the park. Location is awesome. I can’t say enough good things about this place."

We got back from cedar point absolutely exhausted not expecting to be immediately met with luxury and comfort! We were provided with drinks, snacks, and amazing comfortable beds! All of our rooms were decorated with beautiful modern furnishings and our bathroom was great too! If you are in the area definitely stay at Kimberly’s!"

Stayed a few nights","The house was perfect for our visit and super clean. It was furnished and stocked well. We liked the large, off-street parking. The firepit area was not right in the back yard as we'd assumed (it was behind a garage building and storage container), but we ended up not using it anyway and there was a nice little porch and plenty of seating inside. There were places to eat and hang out close by and we had a great visit. The owner was great to work with and we felt the cost was a good value for a ice place to stay. We would stay here again."

Stayed one night","After looking at the photos and then arriving to the location, I felt partially misled. This is a mobile home and none of the pictures show that at all. It is directly located on a busy street and we heard loud cars going by all night. There is a smell in the home as well- maybe of past smokers, I am not sure exactly but it isn’t entirely pleasant. They do have a cleaner come in, and overall the home was clean. Beds were clean and comfortable. There were multiple hairs left in the bathroom shower which didn’t feel very clean. We only stayed one night after a day of Cedar Point. It was a very average stay, one we probably would have gotten at a decent hotel nearby. For the price of $278 for one night (after fees etc), I think we could have gotten the same if not nicer at a local hotel."

Plenty of pots pans plates etc. The boat detailing place next door was cleaning some boats and there was a very unpleasant smell drifting onto the property the whole time we were there, but that isn’t really the hosts fault, it was just annoying. The other issue we had was there were some rocks in the water near the dock and our boat got stuck on them. They should be marked but we’re not. Only other recommendation I have would be to bring your own sheets (I didn’t care for them, but that is my preference)."

The place could have used more cleaning in the fridge and bathroom trim. The only other misleading information on this listing is that it is a double-wide. I think the picture of the home needs to be included in the picture listings instead of after booking. Overall good stay here.

There is a nice little seating area by the lake with a gas burning fire pit that is convenient and cozy. I do wish that the listing was a little more forthcoming that Renee’s place is actually a mobile home and that it sits directly next to a large boat repair shop, which is your view when sitting on the back deck. It is definitely not what we expected from the listing’s pictures and description. Having said that, it is still roomy enough on the inside (for our group of 4) and kept clean. There were definitely sufficient amenities. We were able to grill out one evening with no problems and would have used the fire pit for roasting marshmallows had we not exhausted ourselves every day with everything we packed in!"

Stayed a few nights","One thing to keep in mind when traveling to Sandusky in general is cedar point traffic. If you are going to cedar point this place is so close and very easy to get there. We were coming here for sports force park, which it is also super easy to get to. Luckily we only got delays on Saturday morning, this location is off the entrance road to the park and it was crazy with traffic Saturday morning. My only suggestion for the rental would be to redo the master bedroom area, it is a little outdated compared to the rest of the house. We would definitely stay here again! Waterfront is looking at the marina."

We spent some time by the lake and used the firepit one evening. If we had more time; we would have definitely gone out on a boat for a day. The house is clean, updated nicely, and even includes some board games for the kids. The location is wonderful if you are visiting Cedar Point. We would choose to stay at Renee’s place again the next time we visit Sandusky."

Stayed a few nights","My advice?
Book this place!
We kept saying how spoiled we felt!
Spotless, fabulous air conditioning, the deck, the view, the people watching, the kitchen stocked with all the dishes, pots & pans, quality glassware, even a bar set better than I have at home!
everything we wished for and more!
We didn’t make it to the speakeasy across the street, but we did have a few Voltair margaritas at Oh Taco, they were lovely!
On a rainy Saturday afternoon we opened up the curtains and watched people Rock Climbing!
…. Yes, there was a lot of clapping and cheering! Some of those kids kicked the climb! We took bets on if two of them were Ryan’s kids.
I can’t see finding a better rental, for family, or a few couples (as we were) in the area!"

Stayed a few nights","I highly recommend staying in Ryan's place if you are in the Sandusky area. This was actually our second time renting the space during a visit to Cedar Point. The place is nice and has a beautiful view of Lake Erie from a nice deck up off the street. Check-in was easy and the downtown Sandusky area was nice with plenty of coffee, restaurants and bars within a short walk. Speaking of bars, there is one downstairs from the space! I didn't get to sample it since it but it seemed pretty cool and is a nice amenity to have at arm's length (for anyone worried about staying above a bar, it closed at a reasonable time and was not terribly noisy underneath). Cedar Point is a quick 8 minute drive so its a great alternative to some cheap hotel. There is a park and playground across from the space too if you have young kids. Highly recommend."

Bring coffee, or if you are like us, just walk 100 yards down the street to Saucy Coffee House. (You may want to go get a smash burger later there, they are incredible!)
We liked the vibe of the bar downstairs, didn’t bother us in the evening, in fact we found it festive! Can’t wait to go back in two weeks!"

It had all the basics - paper products, kitchen utensils, plates, cups, wine bottle opener, linens, etc. - plus fluffy towels! It's easily walkable to lots of local bars and restaurants. You couldn't hear the bar downstairs from the bedroom and we appreciated that it was pet friendly. The huge balcony was a surprise plus! The rock wall was neat, though there weren't many climbers during our stay. Excellent value for the money and Ryan was communicative. We didn't have any issues during our stay, but if we had, I suspect he would have responded immediately. We visited Sandusky for a family reunion and come back regularly. We hope to rent this place again in the future."

It was so comfortable, equipped with everything that you didn't realize you needed, and is in such a unique location. We were here for a long weekend-- one day at Cedar Point (Halloweekends), and two nights just relaxing. The Airbnb is withing walking distance to lots of restaurants and bars, and a super quick drive to Cedar Point. I'd especially recommend Volstead, a bar across the street, for a couple cocktails or craft beer. We try not to travel to the same place twice as a rule, but we may need to make an exception here. Will recommend to family and friends!"

Yes, there is some noise from the bar downstairs, but it’s not excessive and doesn’t go very late in the evening. We didn’t cook, but the kitchen seemed to have enough to prepare meals; there was even a decent selection of spices as well as the usual leftover items from previous guests.
Tip: If you’re a coffee lover, Boom Town Coffee is a block away. In addition to making good coffee, they’ll grind beans for you to use in the Mr. Coffee drip maker in the kitchen and then enjoy on the large rooftop deck."

The actual key to get into the door at the top of the stair Took quite the extra time to get it just right in order to unlock.

This place is located right above Paddle and Climb and you can view the rock wall Thru the windows in the kitchen! The whole place is beautiful. We stayed with 6 ladies total and had plenty of room to sleep. Would stay again"

Group trip","I planned a last minute surprise adventure trip for my daughter’s 11th birthday. It involved horseback riding in Oak Harbor, the drive thru Safari in Port Clinton, fishing at Shoreline Park and going to Nickel Plate Beach for a quick dip. Ryan’s hip loft in downtown Sandusky was the perfect location. We had a wonderful late lunch at the Landmark and morning coffee drinks at Boom Town Coffee. So many cute shops in the area. The magnificent views from the deck of Lake Erie with Cedar Point in the distance and the cool view of the rock climbing wall iwas all that was needed to impress my 11 and 13 yr old girls and their friends. It was a short over night stay with all of us wishing to stay longer to kayak and explore some more. We’ll definitely be back. Thank you again!"

Ryan was quick to communicate the rooms availability and get us into the loft within two hours. The whole unit was very inviting with comfortable common spaces, blankets, books, and lots of natural light. Even as a winter destination, Sandusky has a lot to offer and the loft was in a great location to walk through downtown or to the lake, visit a playground, or get a last minute meal at one of the neighboring restaurants. I would definitely book again."

It’s very quiet at night, with comfortable beds, clean modern bathrooms and kitchen, and plenty of space to spread out. We loved the rooftop patio and saw some great sunsets - and one night of an amazing lightning show from the storms rolling across the bay. We ran into Ryan a few times, and he and the team at Paddle and Climb were very friendly and helpful. It was great having Maca Root downstairs to get a latte or smoothie in the morning and enjoy their patio. Wonderful location for walks along the bay and near our favorite restaurants and bars downtown."

It was a great deal and the condo is super clean and well-stocked with kitchen supplies and anything else you might need. The beds are SUPER comfortable and I want to get the same memory foam mattress for my own place. The condo itself was very attractive and has a lovely porch to watch sunsets on the lake from. Communicating with Ryan was very simple and he responds quickly. He offered some tips for visiting the local islands and checked in a couple times throughout our stay to make sure everything was okay. I will 100% book the Sky Loft again next time I visit CP."

Stayed with kids","The pictures on air bnb look very nice which is what got my attention. But once we got in the condo and got settled in there was a lot of dust everywhere, picked up the rug in the sitting area and swept tons of dirt looks like they hadn’t swept in months. The kitchen needed cleaned before we cooked and some of the dishes were dirty. Even though I always rinse out dishes before I use them somewhere else , these were dirty . The kitchen chairs were missing screws . My mother in law fell. I messaged them about it and they told me I was basically lying that they had just screwed everything in before we arrived which I knew was a lie because the screw was totally missing . And not only one chair but 3 of them. And they did not come and fix them and that and the fall happened the first day we were there so we couldn’t all sit at the table the whole stay. It was a very nice lay out and nice decorations. And responses were quick when I had questions. But cleanliness was not there . And the problem with the chair wasn’t fixed. They just automatically asked if we wanted refunded. I just would have been happy to have the 80.00 or more dollars I paid them to clean when I left to be refunded because I cleaned more while we were here then they did before we arrived . I will add CastawayBay was very worth the trip though! Me and my kids had a blast!"

Ryan was an excellent host, responding quickly to our questions and even answering some before we thought of it. The crew at Paddle and Climb were very welcoming and accommodating, as well. I’d give 6 stars if I could. The only downside is we didn’t want to leave! I can’t wait to plan my next trip and stay in Ryan’s sky loft. Thanks again! Cheers"

Stayed one night","We stayed at the Office for just one night. Due to a change in plans, we were there less than 12 hrs. It was late when we arrived & we were tired. Still, we had trouble finding the building. (I’m sure it didn’t help that our GPS wasn’t talking!)
I share this to give you context. Once we found the building & figured out where to park, we easily found our way to the unit using the instructions provided. It was well-equipped & we slept well on the bed. My husband was especially grateful for the Keurig, coffee pods & creamer. And if we had arrived earlier, the location would have been perfect for exploring!
But the wall-to-wall carpet was stained in several places near the door, the shelves in the bathroom were dusty, the bottom of the shower walls were yellow, the bath mats were dirty & there was no direct lighting over the sink.
Also, the only response I got from the host was after booking, even though I messaged her on the way and upon check-out. Now 36 hrs later, still nothing!"

Unfortunately the wifi was pretty slow so we had to work at a nearby Starbucks and couldn’t work in the room. When we booked the place we were also so excited to sit out on the patio but when we got there there were a lot of spiders so we were afraid to use it. I know this is common for the area, but I just wanted to let future travelers know. The room itself was very clean and comfortable though."

Stayed a few nights","Location is everything, so being wiithin walking distance to Lake Erie, visually able to see Cedar Point, view the water, and walk to great places to eat, parks and bench seating on the water, is what we really wanted. Our room was nice and clean, we had easy access to the courtyard. However, the courtyard was covered in spider webs and far from inviting. Our toilet had black mold and needed cleaning. We also noticed noise above us, either an apartment or part of the airbnb. When Nikki did reply she gave helpful ideas of places to eat. We didn't meet our host.
We hope to make a day trip back to Sandusky sometime to follow up on the things we didn't have time to enjoy. Sandusky is a nice place to visit."

I had booked this property for 3 nights but only stayed for one night and and had to book another property because I couldn’t sleep on that bed. Also, we saw a cockroach and spider the same day we arrived. The shower looked dirty as well. The host didn’t even respond when I reached out."

Stayed one night","Nikki's place in Sandusky was a prime spot to walk to all downtown Sandusky has to offer... restaurants, bars, shops and waterfront music. She was quick to respond to communication and allowed for special requests made. Check in was very easy and parking is close and free. King size bed with extra blanket, TV, mini fridge and microwave available. The overhead fan and window a/c unit made it very comfortable."

(If you’re a big breakfast person this is a must) We also stopped at Mr. Smith’s Coffee House on our way out of town and they have a huge selection of anything you could want and an eclectic vibe. They also have a variety of coffee bean flavors and ground our Snickerdoodle coffee for us. Our room was perfect for the two of us and had a big tv, Keurig, and water bottles in the fridge. The backyard area is lit up at night, has comfortable seating, and a very relaxing vibe. Would definitely stay again! A street away from Lake Erie and the Jet Express!"

Stayed a few nights","We were in town for a sports tournament and needed an well-located, clean, safe and comfortable home base to rest and recharge after several hours traveling and after a long tournament day. Tessa's property delivered. It was all we could have hoped for: easy to find, close to sports facilities as advertised, as well as restaurants and shopping, but still in a peaceful, quiet neighborhood. The guesthouse itself was comfortable, clean and had every amenity you could ask for. Having recently had a back injury, bed comfort was a big concern, but the next morning was the best it had felt in over a week. For less than/approximate price of a hotel suite, you get the entire guest house. Privacy, room to roam and relax on comfortable couches, cook your own meals or eat take-out at the kitchen counter on the counter stools or at the 4-top table. Our host was friendly, responsive and accommodating of our uncertain scheduling, thanks Tessa! We've bookmarked and will return in the future."

You can walk anywhere downtown and there is always something going on especially in the summer. If you are a boater, this is an ideal location. The Paper District Marina is literally just a walk through a connected gate. We docked our boat at the marina all weekend and it was super convenient. Great weekend for boating around Sandusky and the Islands. Again, Chesapeake is a great location to do all that. It was very nice coming back each evening to a nice clean place to crash.

It was very clean with great amenities, walkable to the Jet Express, and all of the great restaurants and bars in the downtown area. Tom & Becky are super communicative and also have a very helpful guide available for the local “things to do”, which we really appreciated! We will definitely be back next time we are in Sandusky! Thank you so much for the great stay 😊"

Few minute drive to Cedar Point (we visited daily) and about 10 to 15o. minutes to big name stores, restaurants, etc. There are also small/local restaurants and food trucks just steps away from the condo.
Would definitely rent again!"

Stayed a few nights","Everything was WONDERFUL!
We know you are all just offering this loft since finishing it. We LOVED it! The only reason we gave 4 stars 2 times was the need for a communication/instruction sheet inside the loft or added to the Air BnB info. For example...where to find the garbage dumpster. We had to ask someone and the first two we asked didnt know either. You would have to ask...its a bit hidden.
We didnt know the space between the living room and big bedroom was open except for the blinds. That could be a big disclaimer if couples are sharing the place. We had our 2 teen girls in their. They whisper anyways...lol!
We struggled to find the keys when we got there. It was another thing yhe people we asked had no clue. They lived there. It might be the ""north of"" pool directions or what ever it was. Maybe something like...When driving in and coming up to the pool area, there is a small building attached and the key boxes are on the side of the building. Maybe its just me though...😊
If there were instructions for anything at all you would like done inside the loft before one leaves, like dishes in the dishwasher, towels in the tub or shower etc. renters could help some. Just ideas.
Thank you again for helping us quickly with feedback with the sink drain pipe.
It was just great! Everything was so nice.
We hope to return"

Stayed one night","Visited with my girlfriend for our anniversary.
This is one of those “secret” spots that you feel lucky having been there. I pray I can someday craft a home as beautiful, comfortable, and unique as the Siesta in Sandusky.
Everything you could think of is catered to before you even know you want it. I enjoyed practicing some origami in the kit provided in the living room — there are puzzles, DVDs, and board games as well if you want to pass time.
She left locally baked Buckeyes in the kitchen so we could try an Ohio favorite. You could see the host’s warm personality through the decor and labelling placed in many places.
Any question you might have is answered before it comes to mind. Check in and check out were extremely easy. The space felt private and safe.
I most greatly appreciated that Lori added a couple additional touches to the space that we noticed upon arrival. She went above and beyond to make our anniversary unforgettable!"

After taking the stairs, you open the door to a beautiful space. Everything you could think of is there for you! The location is close to downtown, so for those that like to take a short hike, you are among the shops, microbrews, Wake Up and Waffle along the beautiful Lake Erie. The famous Cedar Point amusement park is near by for those that love a good roller coaster or two!
We look forward to staying in this place again!!"

We visited Sandusky for the second year in a row for my husband's birthday trip. Lori went out of her way to make the trip extra special, with birthday touches throughout the apartment. The apartment is exactly as listed, superbly clean and tidy, very homey, comfortable, and well stocked with everything you could need. The location is absolutely perfect for anyone visiting downtown Sandusky or Cedar Point. We loved being able to run home in the afternoons to make lunch and save money from eating at the park, as well as take a quick break from walking, the location truly could not be more perfect, about an 8 minute drive to the park. Lori recommended other things to do, left us a delicious snack, and was exceptionally responsive. We won't stay anywhere else when we visit Sandusky in the future. Thank you so much Lori!"

Condiments, hair spray, tooth brush? It’s all there! We didn’t drive more than 20 minutes to get anywhere we went, but there are so many places within 10 minutes or less. Shopping, dining, attractions, fishing. There’s even a Little Clinic nearby if you end up with an emergency like us. Lori herself was friendly, and we loved her dog! I had an issue with the thermostat and she was quick to help. We have to make a quick trip back up to Sandusky sometime before the summer ends and I hope we can get Lori’s place again!"

If you are used to keeping your place cooler than 72 in the summer, this one won't. The A/C programming changed to 76 after several hours, so nights were warmer than we liked. Lori tried to fix the programming, but it still reset at midnight. We are from Arkansas and keep our A/C on 68 in summer, so this is something to think about if you're like us. However, this would not keep us from coming back. It was perfect!!!
We even left a couple shirts in the closet and Lori shipped them to us. ❤️"

Stayed one night","only rented this place for one night to rest our heads after a long day at cedar point and only regret not staying longer. we were going to rent a hotel room in the area instead but the prices were outrageous which lead us to this lovely diamond in the rough. this place is so beautifully detailed and I found so much excitement in exploring it all. Lori really thought of everything from filtered water, to spices in the cabinet, to even little cheese slices for grilled cheese and other snacks. I loved all of the little notes. Even when the lock box was broken she was careful to leave me a note of where to find the key. I would warn that the beds are quite stiff so if that's not your jam just be prepared and they AC can be a little fussy. but take those more as warning signs than deterrents because this place is too delightful to not visit."

My husband is a Sandusky native, so we knew the location would be perfect! The beds weren’t comfortable for us, but that’s a personal preference. Lori was extremely responsive and I loved the decor!"

Stayed with kids","Lori's upstairs apartment is a beautiful, well thought out and modern amenity set in an historically old property . A wonderful mix of history in the building frame, ecclectic south west decor but not lacking any of the comforts of home and presented to a very high standard. we found downtown and the lakeside to be 10-20 minutes walk away and cedar point to be 10-25 minutes drive depending on traffic. There is a great pizza restaurant/take away just 5 mins away-Cameo. we also loved the dockside cafe, 15 mins walk away. This is my wifes favourite airbnb and one of my top 10!"

Stayed a few nights","If you are looking for an extremely comfortable place to stay in Sandusky, OH with an interior like no other, which is only minutes from Cedar Point... then this is your place!!! The host, Lori, is one of the most wonderful people you will ever meet, and her pupper Eskimo is the sweetest boy! She was very accommodating, respectful, and communicative prior to, and during our visit! Not only did she allow us to check-in early since we were driving from Buffalo, NY, but she gave us a list of all of the fireworks shows around town (we arrived on July 4th), as well as parking directions to/from CP, and a convenient map right on the side of the fridge! Even on both 91° days that we were there, our AirBnB was cool and air conditioned which was a massive relief as well. We will definitely be coming back!"

Lori, the owner who lives downstairs, put an amazing amount of effort into making this place the perfect small town vacation getaway. If you are looking for a place to stay to go to Cedar Point or any of the other Sandusky attractions, this is right in the middle of all of it. Great communication and many small touches here and there that make all the difference. Cannot recommend it enough!"

Can’t recommend her and her place enough! Will definitely try it to come back and stay there again.

The host, Lori, had bought some local buckeye chocolates for us to try and had so many other bits and pieces like shampoo and soap arranged for us, which were really lovely touches. Really can’t praise enough - keep doing what you’re doing Lori! If you’re thinking about visiting - don’t hesitate, this place is perfect for Cedar Point or a getaway."

Stayed with kids","Omg! Our stay was great. It was a family Cedar Point Birthday celebration weekend. Lori was so welcoming. We met her on our way to dinner for my hubby's birthday. Her eclectic home was just as welcoming with such history in the ceiling, Tiffany lamps, glass windows, art work and other furnishings mixed with minor modern updates that didn't overshadow the history of the home. Charles was greeted with a birthday balloon. She also left treats and snacks for us as well. The bedrooms were cozy and the beds were very comfortable. Lori was quick to respond to any questions asked.
The house was very clean as well. It was overall just a very enjoyable and relaxing stay. We would love to stay again.."

She’s lovingly turned this historic gem into a comfy modern stay with notes to old charm. We stayed for a night, but this seems like a good place for a longer stay as well. It’s also bigger than we anticipated from the photos and well stocked."

Lori's rules were well established and written out. Any questions or concerns that I had during my stay were answered or attended to in a timely fashion on the app.
As a guest and home owner, I realized that her and I had similar guidelines as it pertains to keeping a living space livable. As a first time AirBnBer,
I'm super glad I picked Lori as a host and I would definitely repeat a stay at the ""Siesta in Sandusky"" if a future opportunity presented itself!"
