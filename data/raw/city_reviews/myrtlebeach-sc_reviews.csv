Wanda is very sweet, she always checks in with us to make sure we are satisfied and to ask if we need anything. We cannot say enough about her or her place. We will definitely be back again!!!"

Stayed with kids","The price reflected the space well. As she notes, it is a smaller room but with everything you need. She notes the recommended amount of people who should stay and I definitely would not try to push that. The free parking is nice but sometimes hard to pull in and out when it is busy. It is also on the top level with a beautiful view but I did not stand out on the balcony for my own personal fear of heights (it is very small like the room). Just hope someone finds this helpful. Definitely worth the price she is asking for and very clean."

Stayed a few nights",Nice stay. Wanda was very responsive and helpful. Only issue was rowdy neighbors on our last night and they were feeding pigeons in the walkway in front of our room so there was bird poop right outside the door. The room is a little small but it was comfortable for my husband and I. Great location and we will definitely consider on future trips.

She literally has everything you need from extra towels, rags, bowls and silverware. You have access to the pool and hot tub which was really nice and plus the breakfast which was complimentary for staying in the building! Would definitely book again, thank you Wanda!"

Stayed a few nights","Wanda’s place was a great value for the price we paid. It is walkable to the Gay Dolphin and other local attractions. It is a little outdated, but makes for a quick getaway as all of the non chain places seem to be. It does have a homier feeling and the pictures are exactly how it looks. The staff at the front desk and restaurant were very nice. The balcony holds 2 people at a time, but has a great view. Would stay there again."

Stayed a few nights","Wanda is a great host. The unit is in an amazing location for beach activities. About a 30 minute walk to Broadway and Boardwalk if your legs are up for it. Close to the airport as well. The room had a bit of a smoke smell to it when we arrived but that is due to the fact the hotel is smoke friendly although Wanda’s unit is not which I really appreciate. Beautiful view. Plenty of beach towels to utilize. Wanda was always a message away when I reached out to her. TV had all the smart apps and channels you could want. Building itself feels a bit antique-ish but for the price you pay (compared to surrounding hotels), you can’t beat it. The AC worked well enough, I came in October so didn’t need to rely on it the way I would have if it were summer time. All in all, Wanda is a super host for a reason. I would say don’t come here expecting a 5 star modern hotel unit, but rather a home friendly environment filled with Wanda’s love."

Stayed a few nights","AMAZING view! Right on the ocean with a direct view, not just a glimps like other places. I loved being able to have coffee on the balcony in the morning, and listening to the waves at night. The unit is simple, which was everything we needed for a vacation spent mostly on the beach. Wanda is gracious enough to provide beach chairs, umbrella and plenty of towels for you. Definitely recommend going in the off season as everything was cheaper and the beach much less crowded. The resort itself is very nice and fairly well kept. If you have a chance to meet Steve the bartender, I highly recommend you sit down and listen to his stories. And let him make you the best Manhattan you've ever had 😉 Overall, fantastic stay and would definitely come back."

Stayed a few nights","This was my first stay in Myrtle Beach and Wanda’s AirBNB made it amazing. The resort was absolutely gorgeous. The view from the balcony absolutely blew me away. I honestly could’ve just sat there the entire trip.
The bathroom, kitchen area and rest of the BNB was spotless and packed with helpful items like towels, silverware, toiletries and more.
The resort that the BNB is a part of is also great. They have a bar with a full menu of food and drinks.
Access to the beach was easy and convenient!
All in all, my time at Wanda’s AirBNB was worth every penny and I will definitely be back next time I go to visit Myrtle beach!"

Stayed a few nights","SMALL! It has 2 beds but there is no way more than 2 people can be comfortable. Even small kids and 2 adults would be too stuffy. There were used razors and butter knives on the bathroom counter with a hint of clutter everywhere else but still okay stay. The view is nice, the balcony can only accommodate 2 people at a time as it is rather small as well, just like the pictures. . The price was a little bit pricey for how small it is, just a little …However, Wanda is a great host though in all, she is very responsive and accommodating for early check in. She left notes of local places which was a plus. Easy check in, easy access, beach is a short walk from room and the hotel has a nice pool area with cabanas and fake grass, very nice touch"

Stayed a few nights","We only stayed 1 of the 2 nights we paid for.
Room was nice , but entire place was loud with f bombs being dropped every other word. The next door neighbors yelling and slamming the door every few minutes. We were there for business and had a pick up truck which really would not fit parking deck but they have an extra lot for larger vehicles. Too bad it was full of small cars and half of them in 2 spots. We were fine in the room but did not feel real safe in the rest of the building due to the crowd they attracted. Weighing all the options we decided to just grab our stuff and leave a day early."

Stayed a few nights","We had to stay for a long weekend and our destination was primarily the convention center and the sports complex behind the convention center. If you have a small family, this is JUST right. We got cozy.... but we only needed a place to sleep, really. We all felt safe, the parking was free, the checking was a BREEZE (like, no check in. Just walk in and go to your unit). That was amazing, because sometimes, that's the most stressful thing about checking in somewhere. The parking garage is pretty tight though. So be mindful of what you drive. If you can drive a smaller vehicle, I would recommend that. I would definitely stay here again. The view is pretty amazing as well. You are on the top floor and get an excellent view of the sunrise over the ocean. There are also books the host has left for people to read and the closet is LOADED with towels. It even has a toaster oven, coffee maker and cups/dishes."

Stayed a few nights",Our stay in Wanda's condo was perfect for our mid-week getaway. Very comfortable with little touches that made us feel right at home. The Christmas lights on the balcony along with the poinsettia in the window helped put us in the holiday season mood. Super clean. Super comfortable bedding with beautiful comforters for those cool nights. The electric fireplace was a great touch and went a long way to set the mood for a romantic evening relaxing in the suite. Highly recommended and Wanda's place will be my first option when looking for accommodations in Myrtle Beach.

Stayed a few nights","Everything looked just like the pictures. Beds and pillows were better than any hotel I’ve ever stayed at. Fully stocked towels and toiletries, even some nice little extras like popcorn. The front desk lady who says she usually works at another property was incredibly sweet and there were fresh cookies out each day of our stay. The only things we didn’t love were the door was a little tricky to do with the combination and the pool we were told was 24 hours but they closed it at 11. The elevator smelled strongly of weed on many of our trips up and down, but that’s no fault of Wandas. She was a great host, friendly and prompt in her communication and we would stay again if In the area. The price was fair for the size and accommodations. The 19th floor view is awesome, my daughter who isn’t a fan of heights would disagree. I loved sitting out listening to the waves. That was probably the highlight."

It’s on the 19th floor and the views are absolutely breathtaking. It’s steps from the beach and the staff at the hotel were absolutely amazing. We got in super early and we’re able to leave our luggage at the hotel and immediately go explore. It’s within walking distance of the boardwalk, broadway on the beach, and so many amazing restaurants. We loved that Wanda left us recommendations for places to eat and also tons of amenities to make our stay that much better. Would absolutely stay again. Highly recommended!"

However, we were disappointed that the lobby was under construction, and we were not informed. It was also not very clean. Also, the smell of weed throughout the building was overwhelming. We couldn't open our patio door because of it. There was even an employee smoking it in the lobby bathroom. The walls had no sound proofing, we could here everything the three different groups of people staying to the room adjoining us said. The language at times was very colorful. We wish we would have known these things before we made our reservation. Did not see this in the reviews."

The staff at this particular resort are standoffish and rude. When we asked the front desk a question we were given an eye roll and an attitude. The man went as far as to ask why we were asking him, and why we didn't read our renters agreement?!...very rude and condescending.
If you do get this condo avoid the staff and you will be fine. The view really was breathtaking. ❤"

The outside grounds are spacious and there is a heated pool, whirlpool, and many large padded chaise lounges that overlook the ocean to relax in.

Stayed a few nights",Codey's place was exactly what we were looking for at Myrtle Beach. Great space and location. Check in was easy and parking across the street was plentiful and spacious. The unit was perfect! Clean and comfortable and the views cannot be beat. Well equipped to cook a breakfast before hitting the beach. Or the multiple pools. Or multiple hot tubs. No other resort we viewed in this area had a better pool deck. We were impressed by the security helping with check in parking and taking care of the pool area. The life guard stand and chair rental company directly down the few steps to the beach were helpful and provided excellent service. Of note you can step on the sand to the left of the pool area without any stair at all. Every restaurant we wanted was within walking distance. We will go back! Thank you Codey!

A broken coffee pot was immediately replaced and our day was instantly returned to normal.

There are minimal supplies in the kitchen, not like the usual airbnb places, but some were available if requested. The pools and common seating areas available on site are very nice, the beach is very easily accessed from the building. The building is centrally located so getting around to things was never a long trip. The set up of the unit is great for a girl's trip or a family vacation, there is plenty of space."

Group trip","PERFECT SPOT IN MYRTLE BEACH
Review of Sandy Beach Resort #1106
Codey is a great communicator about the condo needs and instructions. Everything was wonderful! Easy parking and access to the condo. Loved the keyless entry. Condo was just as described, clean, and well-maintained. Felt like we were right on the beach when sitting on the balcony. Everything we could have possibly needed was readily available in the condo, some more kitchen/oven dishes could be helpful . Location was perfect! Beach was not overly crowded. It was a great 3BD 3BR rental on the 10th floor and a perfect end of summer getaway for the entire family. Would absolutely stay here again and again.

Stayed with kids","This was a last min vacation. Codey was very communicative the few times I reached out to him. Here is what I thought of the place:
Pros: great ocean view, Good size rooms. Carpet has been removed. So now there is flooring. Washer & dryer in the condo. Great location, Place was clean,I saw security walking on the premises everyday. The room service ladies were very nice when I asked for a trash bag. Overall a good place to stay.
Cons: while I pack much of what I need, the condo needs the little “at home touch” for an Airbnb.
Be ready to either pack or buy pretty much anything you need to be comfortable with exception of towels & so kitchen essentials. I know some wouldn’t mind but am used the Airbnb having that little touch. But don’t make this discourage you from staying. Just fyi to make sure you pack accordingly."

Stayed with kids","This unit was absolutely perfect for our ""big family vacation"" with mom, dad, brother, his wife and kids. The kids had a wonderful time at the pool each day. There were always plenty of beach chairs at the pool, plenty of towels to dry off afterward. Going from the pool to the unit is very fast, and safe enough to let at 10 and 13 year old run pretty free at the pool with no worries about cars or too-deep water. There were 2 friendly security guards that walked the grounds constantly - they said hello and were always nearby. One night someone dropped a glass near the pool desk - they had it blocked off and cleaned up within 15 minutes. The patio was an amazing view. Everyone enjoyed their rooms. The air conditioning works amazingly well, hot day at the beach and then come back to a nice cold room to recharge and sleep. There are a lot of things to do nearby. We walked the boardwalk and down to a few restaurants nearby. If you bring a big family like ours I'd recommend bringing paper plates though - no one wants to do dishes! Bring a crock pot too if you have a chef in the family.
Parking was very easy. We received 3 parking passes for the week and there was always a spot to park.
The place was very clean and has a hard floors & broom - easy cleanup when the kids run in with sandy feet. it was easy to keep clean the entire week we were there. We hope to stay again!"

Stayed with kids","We had a very nice family vacation. Nice views from the 10th floor balcony and the apartment was very clean. Very good location - except for grocery shopping we really did not need our car - everything is close by. And of course there is this wonderful beach.
Couple of things though we were not so pleased about. The kitchen is VERY sparsely equipped. 5 plates, 5 glasses, 5 knives, 5 spoons, no wine glasses. So if you don't want to run a half-empty dishwasher multiple times a day and you come by car - consider bringing your own. Also, we often noticed the stent of weed in the hallways and on the balcony. Maybe because it was spring break, although there are signs everywhere about 'no smoking'."

Stayed a few nights","Great location and pools, but the place was very low-ball as far as appointments. For instance, there was an old stained couch and small chair in the living area, very uncomfortable for 4 people. They looked and felt like castoffs from another project. The cabinets were plastic veneer, torn in several spots. One of the toilets was twisted sideways and wouldn't flush properly, sink spouts were off center, and there was dried food on the counter. I assume these items were all in anticipation of spring-break abuse, but we are 4 60-somethings who expected better."

Broadway at the beach was about a 10 minute drive . Also a food lion only 7 minutes away , the grill is first come first serve by the pool . Pool is open 8am -11pm , the rooms are exactly what they look like on the photos except the carpet and kitchen table needs to be updated ASAP , the rest of the rooms are updated . Codey the host was very quick to respond and helped with any services you might need , great host ."

For my husband and I the location is perfect. It’s not far from restaurants, and shopping close to the 2nd Avenue Peir and sky wheel! About 15-20 minutes from the boardwalk I believe. But we just got an Uber. Our only complaint about Myrtle beach in general is that the “locals/vendors” are rude, and pushy and very much not approachable."

My husband and I were only staying for the weekend for a competition he had. Michael has a nice apartment and he is a great host. My only problem is with the building itself. The building is so run down and unwelcoming. It smells like cigarettes. And the walls are very thin. We actually ended up staying in the hotel across the street that is on the beach. I never asked for money back or reached out to the host because it was not his fault at all. We just didn't feel comfortable staying in that building.

Everything was so clean and organized when we arrived and checkin took less than a minute. We loved that there were pots, pans and other household items already there for our convenience.

We did our best not to bring sand inside with us, but difficult when you’re in a beach town. I liked the mini arcade, sets this place apart from other rentals. There were some other card & board games we would have liked to play had we had the time. Pool closed at 9pm which was a bummer and the next day the lazy river had been drained, otherwise, the pool options looked enjoyable. I recommend this place."

The location being om the South side of Ocean Blvd was so much better...because minimal people stay there more than North, which left us lotsof open space at the beach to set up, there were several places that were walkable...we had the pool to ourselves pretty much everytime we went. we all had a place. The kis and my husband all enjoyed the arcade games! Our little girl loved hanging our om the balcony. It was quiet overall, but you could hear live music from next door if you like dancing! We'd definitely stay here again!"

Luckily we were able to get settled in and take a 3 min walk to the shore to relax like utter beach bums for the rest of the day! If you need any groceries/drinks/supplies there’s a neighborhood Walmart 1 minute drive away. There’s also a the spring garden restaurant nearby, we kept going back for their pancakes, hash browns, sausage gravy biscuits, and our waitress April! Between relaxing and getting ready for each day, we would play some of the arcade games in our down time…golden tee is fun but I think that game is rigged on the short game cause I was chopping a lot of trees lol. Overall, we love visiting Myrtle for great beach days and a relaxing vacation, so we couldn’t have asked for a better stay!"

Stayed a few nights","The entire resort is just ok, not bad, not spectacular, however, Michael's Condo in the interior was in great condition, clean, supplied with basic stuff you need, he was courteous and explained stuff in a very clear manner for the arrival.
This is definitely a great option if you're considering small size resorts at Myrtle Beach. not very luxurious but great for the price. Also the area around is very touristic, so you can literally walk to many places from there. We liked it."

The location is probably the best part, considering it is only about a 10-20 minute drive to anything you could possibly want to do & for the price as well. You can’t beat it, I would definitely recommend and return!"

Stayed a few nights","Great little Bnb, exactly as described and pictured. Great location for beach, and for walking to restaurants and other places! A short drive to boardwalk, piers, and skywheel. My boyfriend and I went for our birthdays and tried a different restaurant everytime we went out, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Tried lots of bars and oceanfront dining, bnb was in the perfect location for it all. Was on the quiet side when we visited so it was pretty peaceful and relatively easy to get around, we had a great time! There were a few sketchy looking individuals around the area but we had no problems, just made sure to keep car locked and valuables in bnb. There were also several nice locals that were friendly, which was nice. Neighborhood Walmart was just across the street which was more than handy. Overall thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would stay again! Thank you for the great Bnb!"

Wish we had a few more towels to work with but there was a washer and dryer on location. We was only there a short time so we didnt have time so we just brought some at the Walmart conveniently located within walking distance. My only complaint was the balcony was a bit unkempt, someone left ashes on the table dont look like anything was wiped down so we didnt get to enjoy that. Michael was a good host for our short weekend trip."

Since a lot of attractions about a mile or two away. Walking takes awhile. So I would keep that in mind if you don’t intend on having a vechile.

Stayed with kids","this is located literally 2 minutes from the beach. You are about a 10 minute drive from the boardwalk and night life. You can drive to anything in less than 15 minutes. the lazy river had the best water temperature. This is a converted Motel. even though the outside doesn't look like much, the inside is beautiful. although we brought our own stuff for the beach he had boogie boards, buckets and shovels which I thought was great. I loved how the kitchen came supplied with everything needed to cook. I would suggest to bring some extra towels if you are traveling in a large group, and to bring a lot of quarters is you plan on doing laundry. Even though there isn't a table inside, it was nice to sit out on the patio and eat. I'd recommend this to anybody staying a week or less. Keep in mind eating out can get pricey so prepare for that. He has great communication and responded even late at night. Michael was a great host. He truly made Myrtle Beach a great experience."

Stayed about a week","Micheal was a great host as he is quick and responsive! During our 10 day stay, he did have some supplies dropped of several times to accommodate us and some issues we encountered- even dropped off a gift for our troubles. I don’t recommend this for a long term stay because the fridge is too small, shower doesn’t work well, and there is no where to store clothing/unpack luggage. If you do stay long term, bring yourself extra towels and quarters. We were able to wash clothes in the coin laundry which was helpful. Be advised that this is a studio unit in a condo building which rents to anyone and there can be some shady renters with no rules about smoking certain things.. The unit is updated inside but the building is a older and run down. If you’re looking for somewhere to stay short term to just sleep in, is affordable, and close to the the beach/Walmart/ highway/ restaurants, and don’t mind the area or neighbors- this is for you."

It was extremely clean, and Carlos was incredibly responsive. This may not be what everyone wants as far as TVs are concerned, but we greatly appreciated the simplicity of having Kindle Fire (similar to our Roku). We don't watch a lot of TV while on vacay, but trying to navigate an incredible number of useless channels is always a turn off for us. So, thank you. We will definitely recommend this cozy little place. Thanks for having somewhere that allowed us to relax."

Stayed a few nights",The view was gorgeous however the room was not worth the price. The pictures on the website are misleading because the room was smaller in person. In my opinion your really paying for the beautiful view of the beach. The rooms around the room we stayed in was loud and somewhat noisy at night. There were no trash cans in the room except in the bathroom for us to dispose of trash. I did not feel safe at night with the lock on the door and how the door had to be locked. The central air was loud whenever the air came on and shut off during the day as well as during the nightThe vents needed to be cleaned due to dust. Overall I enjoyed the stay just overpriced for the room.

Take note that the SeaWatch resort itself is a VERY busy place. I wouldn’t recommend it to someone trying to have a “quiet, calm, romantic getaway” but if you’re looking for the “true Myrtle Beach” experience, this is a great option for you."

Stayed about a week","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Carlo was helpful, making the check-in seamless. The creative design of the apartment made it comfortable for two people. The amenities were even better than expected. Having a washer and dryer in the unit was a great addition. The view of the ocean was outstanding. Excellent golf courses are located nearby the studio. Caledonia Golf and Fish Club on Pawley’s Island was an incredible experience and worth the drive. We enjoyed seafood restaurants nearby and at Murrells Inlet. We highly recommend Carlo’s Airbnb rental."

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I had never stayed at an Airbnb so initially we did not know what to expect. Carlos (with Airbnb) was fantastic in getting us accurate information promptly to the point that when arriving, we felt like we had already been there. Outside of needing a little more ""closet"" space for clothes, the facility was excellent. Being a fanatic for cleanliness this condo met all my (our) expectations. To top it off, 72 degrees in December at the beach made for a wonderful time.
Thanks Carlos"

Stayed a few nights","Lovely and clean with a perfect view! If you are just two people, you can be very comfortable as the space is not large, but well designed. The balcony view of the ocean and sunrise will delight you. The sofa allowed for a view of the TV, and fireplace. You won't see the pool area from inside as you are on a higher floor. You'll like the firm bed that is on a platform so it doesn't make any noise when you roll over. And there is storage underneath to keep the suitcases out of sight. The kitchen is equipped to make eating in easy for you also. Washer dryer combination allows you to keep clothes and towels fresh and the shower has a clothesline to hang wet beach wear. There are no issues with water pressure, cell signal or connecting to internet. The transparent top of the shower curtain will allow for an ocean view-so enjoy!"

The unit itself was great. Located right off the elevator on the 18th floor. So being so high up the view was awesome and the was literally no noise other than the waves.
Jacquie was very helpful and any minor issues were addressed. She was great. Nothing is ever perfect but this little gem was close to that. If you’re a couple that wants to get away or even if you have a little one. This is a great location with great beaches and access as well as very nice pool and heated lazy river."

Stayed a few nights","This condo was AMAZING! When you walk in the door and all you see is the ocean, you really cannot beat that. The resort was easy to find and the condo itself is directly in front of the elevators. The condo was very spacious and we especially loved having the separate living room to binge shows on at night! The kitchen was clean and well stocked with everything you could need to cook up a great meal. The bathroom was clean and I appreciated the full length mirrors on the door! Great sunscreen face wipes in the bathroom! The beds were super comfortable. The highlight however is that gorgeous oceanfront balcony! We ate breakfast every morning out here and I would sit out listening to the waves until late in the evening. Resort amenities were great, especially the fitness center. I cannot recommend this condo or host enough! Jacquie was a great communicator, very responsive, and friendly! We will definitely be back!"

With the balcony door opened the ocean sounds were very relaxing. Also the views of the beach, sunrise and sunset were awesome. The pool and jacuzzi (indoor and outdoor) always were relaxing after a day of exploring. Many restaurants within walking distance from fast food to upscale meals. Some of our favourites were Bumz, Wiseguys, and River City Cafe. There was also a General Dollar store less than 5 minute walk for many general needs. Overall this Airbnb is a great value for the price."

I loved the memory foam pillow, my mom loved the cotton pillow. We were in town for a volleyball tournament at the convention center, and the CS was so close we could walk. There are tons of restaurants in the area, anything from sit-down to fast food. My daughter and I loved the hammocks. We would definitely stay with Jacquie again, and would recommend her place to anyone."

Truly cloud-like.
From booking until I arrived home, Jacquie proved to not only be an amazing host, but an amazing, caring human. I cannot wait to book with Jacquie again."

It was such a sweet and thoughtful gesture that made us feel incredibly welcomed. Jacquie really went above and beyond to make our stay special. We couldn't have asked for a better host. Thanks, Jacquie! You truly made our experience unforgettable! 🌟"

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful location and building. View phenomenal however unit itself was extremely neglected. I'm not the type to complain over minor cleaning issues but this unit needed a thorough deep clean. Host offered to have cleaner return but I was visiting for a funeral and wasn't comfortable having cleaner I complained about come while I was there. It was excessively dirty, food stains on walls, stuck to my socks on floor in-between beds. Host sided with cleaner and became defensive instead of trusting my pictures (sent about 30 showing the cleaning issues) Luckily off season prices were reasonable but I would not rent again. Have never complained about an Airbnb and was surprised to be not believed. unfortunately I didn't have it in me to fight over it."

Stayed a few nights","The condo was great. Being on the 18th floor gave a beautiful view of the beach and the ocean. The electronic door lock meant never having to worry about leaving the keys. The location of the living room versus bedroom some may dislike. When you enter you are in the living room, pass through the kitchen, and into the bedroom where the balcony is. Thus it is not possible to sit in the living area and listen to the waves. Personally I loved this because I could leave the slider open and listen to the waves while sleeping -- sound very relaxing. I loved my stay here."

Host was responsive when we asked questions about how to get the local TV channels. Only thing I would change is if it could be figured out how to keep the local channels available in the living room without leaving the TV on. When we turned it off, we had to rescan to get the local channels. Other than that small thing, absolutely loved the place! The host did try to assist us multiple times, but it was an issue with the TV itself, nothing she could do, but she sure tried to help out!"

Stayed a few nights","Overall, my stay in this unit was good. You can definitely tell the hosts are committed to ensuring their clients are satisfied. Besides my cons listed below, I would recommend this unit to someone else.
Pros:
1. Unit is exactly as pictured. The Oceanview is amazing!!
2. Hosts are very responsive and professional.
3. Convenient location
4. The hosts thought of every detail in the unit, i.e., providing snacks, makeup wipes, speaker for music, etc.
Cons:
1. Although the overall unit was clean, the toilet seat wasn't clean. There was urine and dust in the area behind the seat, where the lid closes.
I informed the host immediately, and she arranged for housekeeping to come clean the toilet, even though it was after 9:30pm. However, I ended up having to clean the toilet since I wasn't in the unit when housekeeping arrived.
2. The building is outdated, and the lights were out in the hallway in front of the unit, so I had to use my phone's flashlight to insert the door code."

I get this is her job but saying the same things several times to someone while they’re on VACATION is not necessary (:"

Everything was absolutely beautiful from the incredible beach views to the room itself. It's very spacious, comfortable, and clean. We cannot thank our amazing host, Jacquie, enough for letting us use this place. She was extremely helpful, and responsive and recommended great activities to do in the area! We will definitely be visiting Myrtle again and booking this place in the future!"

The condo is gorgeously decorated, with lots of amenities (the coffee was a huge plus), and with a breathtaking view. I fell asleep listening to the waves and woke up to seagulls gathered on the sand welcoming the rising sun. I will def keep this spot on my list for a longer stay!"

The condo, although small, had plenty of room for the two of us and was stocked with everything needed for our stay — even a fan for “white noise” that we thought we would have to pick up at Walmart! We were especially pleased to have front row “box” seats to New Year’s fireworks right at midnight! We hope to return next year!"

Stayed with kids","The location was perfect, and the decor and layout of the unit are excellent choices for the location. Free parking was a perfect accommodation as most places charge a daily fee. However during our stay I don't feel like the place was cleaned sufficient prior to our arrival ; nor has it been getting a thorough cleaning for the price charged at booking. Being the owner of a Cleaning company I reminded myself how particular I am and to not scrutinize so much. However, some of the things I saw were just unacceptable for a 5 star air bnb. I will share photos of a wine glass I cleaned compared to another from the cabinet. The coffee pot had water residue in it as if it had only been rinsed out. There was dust and dirt build up in places a I feel are unacceptablefor a 5 star. The towel bar above the toilet had a layer of dust on it. In addition to, the shower bar had rust and stains on them. The room had a musty smell to it. The pool room had a hole in the ceiling with debris hanging out barely blocked off with no caution signs near the stair entry to the pool. I do see the 5 star potential, but cleanliness in Covid times is crucial. (especially because in the elevator it specifically states no late checks due to extra time to clean because of covid)
I will mention that Jacquies is very responsive and checked in on me. I appreciate that."

Stayed a few nights","Second time staying here with Jacquie and it was just as wonderful as the first! Property was immaculate and she goes above and beyond to ensure that you are comfort and taken care of throughout your stay!! Perfect location within walking distance to some great restaurants and a Starbucks! The view is so breathtaking, especially at sunrise!!"

Stayed a few nights","The condo is a nice, clean, cozy place to enjoy a beach getaway. Everything we needed was there!
Beautiful view of the ocean from the bedroom and patio. Easy access to pools and beach! Perfect little place!"
