Stayed a few nights","Went on an impromptu aurora viewing trip & thankfully found this wonderful, clean home to stay the weekend! Having two bathrooms and a full laundry area was a huge plus. The home is absolutely lovely, it is obvious a lot of thought went into the decor and the design of the spaces. It was so peaceful there.
The bedding is some of the softest and coziest I've experienced. The bath towels were super thick & absorbent. The bathrooms were very clean & had ample counter space & hooks. The furniture was all in very good shape and comfortable. It was nice to have so many reclining chairs available.
The best feature is the lake view. You can see it from the living room, enclosed porch, and the main bedroom. The view is spectacular!
If you end up staying here, know that you will be walking through uneven grass to get to the property. It was slippery after the rain, and I could see it being an issue for anyone with mobility problems. Otherwise, it's overall a perfect location!"

Stayed a few nights","Staying in this vacation retreat on Lake Erie was a perfect pre-Christmas get-away for my wife and I. She wondered if we would be warm enough with the winds on the shoreline, but we were very comfortable with adjustable heating and cozy quilts on our roomy and comfy bed. And the unobstructed view of Lake Erie was magnificent. As we looked out there were no houses, parked cars, or traffic going by as we enjoyed seeing the ever-changing waters. The bright kitchen had every convenience including an excellent washer and dryer to the side. The neighborhood location was also ideal for us. Quiet side streets and an easy drive to both a large grocery store and the quaint shops and variety of restaurants in historic Ashtabula Harbor. This rental is not part of any resort, but we sure felt as if we were at one!"

Stayed a few nights","Just left from a great 3 night getaway. The cabin is perfect for 2 and Cathy truly thinks of everything. There was wine and chocolates waiting to enjoy that evening while sitting on the porch swing enjoying the sounds of nature… She had muffins in the freezer if we wanted to have them breakfast. Multiple types of coffee and creamers… fire pit was ready to go with everything you need, including marshmallows. Bathroom was fully stocked with anything you may have forgotten. The town of Ashtabula has some really good, quaint restaurants. The longest covered bridge in the US is really close. There are 23 (I think) wineries in the area and are great places to spend the day with live music at most all weekend. We truly enjoyed visiting and will definitely return. Highly recommend"

We loved the patio - perfect place to enjoy morning coffee or evening wine. The cabin had wood for camp fires, ample outdoor seating. Thoughtful plentiful toiletries. Simple cooking items (cooking spray, salt and pepper). Heating and AC both were great. We would love to return! The location was 5 min from grocery stores and 15-20 min from tons of wineries which we enjoyed visiting! To note, the cabin does not include a stove or hot plates at this time. There is a microwave, toaster oven, and grill outside. Just note this in meal planning!"

Stayed a few nights","If you are looking for a place in Ashtabula or the nearby area, Alexa's place is perfect. It is walkable to some of the areas best restaurants. It is a short drive to the beach. (I would recommend driving there since the beach is down a steep road and wouldn't be fun to walk back up.) The townhouse is on the main road in town but I wasn't bothered by traffic noises. The townhouse itself is brand new and the furnishings are top of the line. The beds were comfortable and there is enough furniture in the living room for everyone to spread out. My visit was during the winter, so we didn't get to take advantage of the two outside areas. Alexa provides a great house manual that includes restaurant recommendations. I loved Fitzgerald's Wine bar and Rennick Meat Market."

Stayed a few nights","This location- a historic small town harbor- was exactly what we were looking for for a couples getaway. There are so many nice, fine dining restaurants to choose from- 2 days was not enough time to try them all. The historic harbor and downtown is so charming, even in a colder month where temps were in the 40s, we absolutely loved it!! We always felt safe and the location was perfect, you seriously can't get a better stay than these townhouses.
In regards to the actual airBNB- quite possibly the cleanest one we've stayed in and for sure the most cozy and attentive. The townhouse was so clean when we arrived with added touches: STOCKED tea&coffee bar, snacks, beach wagon, things to do recommendations, fully stocked kitchen, enough bath towels and wash cloths, pillows and blankets...etc.). The host also provides a lot of friends and couples games to pass time. The host was so quick to answer questions and reply to messages. We look forward to future stays here."

Stayed with kids","We stayed in a Ashtabula during Labor Day Weekend. First time at Lake Erie in Ohio and we had a great time. Our 3-year old loved watching the bascule bridge open and close, and watching the ships go through.
Ashtabula Harbor had a great selection of restaurants and stores. Less busy and touristy than Geneva on the Lake.
We enjoyed playing at Walnut Beach and strolling along Walnut Boulevard to see some of the historic homes in the town.
Short drive to both Geneva and Conneaut along Lake Rd for some great views of Lake Erie. We only stayed for a weekend but there seemed to be a lot to do if you stay a week.
Thanks Alexa, for hosting us!"

We have stayed in AirBnB rentals in a number of locations in the US and France and Alexa's is definitely 5 star. The space is beautiful and is exactly as shown in the photos. Entry into the house was very simple with explicit directions from Alexa prior to arrival.
The entire house was superbly clean, the amenities in the kitchen were very welcome, the beds were comfy, and there was plenty of hot water. The only thing we lacked in the kitchen was a tea kettle.
The house is excellently located, easy to find, with a lovely 2 car locked garage, and in walking distance to some very nice restaurants.
All in all, we had a brilliant time. We highly recommend Alexa's AirBnB and would happily book another stay here next year."

They’ve thought of everything that you would need to make your stay comfortable and fun. It’s all brand new and impeccably clean. I LOVED it. Alexa the host is without a doubt the most kind host I’ve ever had. I will only stay at her properties when I fly to Ohio. Her attention to detail is unsurpassed and her eye for style and decor can’t be beat. It’s located in a cute spot called the Harbor. The Rennick Meat Market restaurant is fantastic along with Briquettes BBQ’s brisket is quite possibly the best bbq I’ve ever had. This place is a must stay for a special weekend celebration. Lots to see and do."

Stayed one night","Beautiful. I booked this as part of a bday weekend for my babe. We had a great stay. I cooked delicious meal and although I brought a few items, the kitchen had everything I needed and more. I felt right at home.
The place was spotless and smelled great. We had a great nights rest. We slept on the first floor and the sheets were sooooo soft and felt so good.
I forgot to bring some games, but there were a few provided which was nice and fun! We played a game for couples.
The area was nice and quiet, perfect for relaxing and quality time.
I would definitely book again."

Stayed a few nights","This place was brand new and beautiful. What I liked best was the little touches - a snack basket, plenty of toiletries for things we needed or forgot, the hammock to be hung on a stand on the back patio, a fully stocked kitchen and spice rack. We didn’t use them but there was even a wagon in the garage to easily pull beach stuff to the lake, books, games and a bluetooth speaker. The garage was really appreciated to tuck our car in over night.
It’s on a busy street, so some traffic noise in main living area, but both bedrooms are on the back side of the townhouse and quiet enough."

Definitely looking to book again in the summer since it's close to the beach. 11/10!

Stayed with kids","We loved our stay! It was the perfect place for our two families to spend a relaxing weekend. The outdoor area was great for the kids to play and for hanging out at the fire pit in the evening.
The home is just like the pictures and an excellent layout for hanging out with the family. The kitchen is fully equipped for meal prep and there is plenty of table space for everyone to enjoy a meal together.
This place is close enough to the beach to walk or bike ride (but also plenty of parking if you're driving). The beach is gorgeous and has a lovely playground too. We also tried out several of the recommended restaurants and they we excellent.
The hosts made everything easy from booking to check out. They were welcoming and informative. They supplied the house with so many extras - coffee and fire wood were our favorites - and made great recommendations.
This is a wonderful choice for a fun, relaxing weekend! Highly recommend!"

Group trip","Dave and Kate were the best hosts that I have dealt with on Airbnb thus far. Their communication is excellent and they get back to you immediately and they are very friendly! Their house was very comfortable, clean and spacious for our group of 8 women for a getaway weekend. We loved the huge kitchen table for gathering, beds were comfortable, and the location was great for walking to the beach and town to shops and restaurants. We planned on using the fire pit, but never got around to it. We cooked in the equipped kitchen. Dave and Kate even ordered a 13x9 pan to deliver before our arrival via Amazon, because they weren’t sure if the kitchen included one. That was so thoughtful and helpful for the breakfast bakes I made. If I am ever in the area again, I would stay at this house again."

Group trip","The home was lovely, easy to find, centrally located and Kate was very responsive and congenial. It’s an older home so there’s some creaking in the floorboards. From the description, I was expecting some beach access from the backyard. That isn’t the case. You have to walk down the street. We were there in the winter so that wasn’t an issue. It was close enough to the main street and I was able to walk to get a latte in the morning at the local coffee shop. Loved that! The lake can be seen from the top floors, but there is a water treatment facility (or something) directly behind the house. There was plenty of space for my family and would have fit many more people. We enjoyed hanging out in the front living room and the kitchen table was amazing! Washer and dryer came in handy. It was in the only bathroom on the first floor, off of the kitchen. All in all, the house was great. I would come back to it, if I ever get the opportunity."

From the milk frother for your coffee in the morning sitting on the gorgeous deck to the mini Bluetooth speaker to the usb charging night stands, these girls have thought of everything. You won’t find a nicer place to stay anywhere. I feel like I just checked into the newest, nicest hotel in the entire state of Ohio. The welcome bottle of wine and snacks were so appreciated.
The see through refrigerator door lights up when you tap it to see what’s inside and the freezer makes those big cool round ice cubes for your cocktails. She even put a basket full of board games and bedtime stories for the little ones. There’s even separate beach towels and sunscreen in the closet for the short stroll to the beach.

Stayed a few nights","I rented this as a place for me to stay during a visit to Ashtabula for a funeral. The condo was absolutely perfect for me. The attention to deal was 5 stars. It was as if I were hosting friends at my residence, and the checklist of what my guests might need was thoroughly fulfilled. It was Beautifully appointed and well maintained. The guest manual provided was most precise.
The host was very responsive to me regarding my needs and concerns. The condo was in a very quaint part of Ashtabula, which is very old. A good walking area that felt quite safe. I would return in the future."

Alexa went above, and beyond any experience I could have expected. Her local recommendations were spot on, and she assisted me with getting flowers delivered to the door for my girlfriend upon our arrival from out of state. The Haven is immaculate, organized, and stocked with everything you need. I will be back!"

There are so many things that stand out....here are just a few!
Alexa has thought of everything you didnt even think of :)
The place is ULTRA clean! enough said.
All of the furnishings are top notch, beautiful and comfortable.
She is SUPER organized....guestbook in the kitchen includes ""how to use"" instructions for every appliance in the house (lots of fun appliances!)
Jar in the hall closet for ""things you may have forgotten"", she provides a wide selection of coffee and teas, snacks, everything you need in the kitchen (+more!!).  The local bottle of wine was a lovely touch!
The location is within walking distance to everything on Bridge Street (even in the winter!!)
If you are planning to spend some time in the area do not hesitate for one moment to stay at Alexa's place. You will not be disappointed."

Overall a convenient location, ideal for a family to stay in. We used the kitchen at least twice a day, it had many basics included that made it easy to cook and prepare meals. The road can be a bit noisy as it is a main road and the only complaint the other guests had were curtains or blinds, especially in the front bedroom would have been nice to block out the streetlights at night. We would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed with kids","First and foremost, I want to say we had a fantastic experience in your home! It was beautiful and very clean. We really enjoyed the comfy blankets and being so close to downtown. We took advantage of the great restaurants and shops. So quaint and everyone we met was super friendly! I always give a few suggestions for improvement. I have included these below:
Bathrooms:
More towels and/or bigger towels provided
Kleenex boxes provided in all bathrooms
There was very little body wash left in each container and no shampoo/conditioner provided. I would suggest installing these units in each shower that have 3 compartments…1 for shower wash, 1 for shampoo, and 1 for conditioner. It would be easier to add to those rather than trying to keep up with replacing body wash containers.
Kitchen:
Personally, I suggest removing all candles from an Airbnb. As a fellow business person, having actual candles in an Airbnb seems like too much of a risk for potential issues…fires & burns. Not worth the risk.
Bedrooms:
Add TVs in each bedroom. These days TVs are cheap. Having large flatscreen TVs mounted on the walls is easy and very luxurious and desirable for families with children and teens.
Unit overall:
I would suggest providing Info either online or in unit itself on nearest grocery stores for essentials, as well as nearest pharmacy & hospitals/doc in the box for emergencies."

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful home in a great neighborhood! A quaint little town is literally just steps away from this lovely home. We walked to Rennick Meat Market for a delicious breakfast. We also walked to a Farmers market. Cindy's home is updated throughout, very clean and well stocked. There is a very private and quiet backyard, and also a covered front porch for your morning coffee. All 3 bedrooms are on the second floor. The double beds in each bedroom were very firm, if that matters to you. There is one full bath on the second floor with a shower/tub combo. The other full bath, with shower, is on the first floor. So it is somewhat of an inconvenience for whoever is using that bathroom. Not ideal, but we made it work with two couples. The home is 15 minutes from the GOTL strip, which was very important to us. Cindy was an exceptional host. She always responded quickly and she is very kind, friendly & flexible. We had no issues while staying at her home. We will definitely stay there again."

The kitchen was a highlight. She provided everything we needed to cook a nice brunch in. The decorations are absolutely fabulous and inspiring. The space is well broken up for everyone staying to have privacy, including a possible work/reading space on the upstairs landing.
We had been worried about phone chargers, but Cindy had 2 lamps with several USB ports. That was so thoughtful! I loved the mattresses in the bedrooms & there is ample storage & hanger space for clothing.
The bathrooms were also a highlight. Each has so much character. While the pictures are accurate, every unique touch is even more striking in person. Cindy also provided makeup wipes which was much appreciated.
The house was pristine & clean, with an unbeatable location. I couldn't be happier with our experience and hope we can return soon!"

The owners are also immaculate. They were super responsive the entire time & had no clean up restrictions which is super rare for AirB&B. Lots of gorgeous touches in the home. The only suggestions we could really give would be to add a projector to the downstairs bedroom & maybe another sliding door for bathroom privacy but otherwise perfect. Really exceptional."

Having all of the bedrooms together upstairs with a nearby full bath was also a huge plus with two young kids. We visited over Thanksgiving and are excited to visit again when there’s warmer weather. This home is conveniently located within walking distance to Bridge Street attractions and Walnut Beach. Thank you for offering your home to us!"

(Not to mention being within walking distance of downtown, too!!). It did smell a little like dog, but I understand it's nice for families with furry friends to be able to bring them, too. There weren't any facial tissues, so I'd say to be sure to bring some with you if you would use them. Otherwise, everything was provided that we might need! The beds were SO comfortable!!

We loved walking to town (it took less than 5 minutes ) ordering a pizza and then coffee in the am , reading all the historic signs of the area. The beach is walkable but we drove since we had a wagon full for our child . Private , not overcrowded . Almost the best kept secret. 🤫 loved the house , spacious and clean , felt relaxing . Geneva on the lake is less than 15 minutes away. John is super responsive to messages ! Very impressed. Didn’t know it was a duplex, but no one seemed home next door 😊"

Living room furniture was plenty and quite cozy. When we initially arrived, we found the front door had accidentally been left hanging open. It was quite unnerving! John was immediately responsive and let us know he was reviewing the footage from the camera. All was well, and though it did take a good hour and a thorough check of the house for me to settle in and feel safe..it was fine. Im sure it was a one time occurrence, but I thought it was handled quickly and well. I’d happily stay again. Very good proximity to Walnut beach and we enjoyed a nice meal at the smokehouse right around the corner. Cute little town!"

Historical pictures in the kitchen and extra blankets in a basket in the living room - linens and towels provided too! All those extra touches made the difference - We felt right at home!
Great location! Close to restaurants, shopping and the beach. Everything within walking distance!
The host provided instructions prior to our date of departure so we were ready for check in. Any communications we had with them, they were quick to respond. So friendly!
We highly recommend recommend them and we definitely plan to come back!!
Thank you!!!"

Cloven Hoof was great for the beer folk. Nights and Weekends had very good pizza, and the speakeasy upstairs was fun with a band. Good meal - terrible service at Halcyon. Quaint shops, the coffee shop is awesome.
Took a taxi to GOTL. $35 for 2 one way. Fun times in an area that looks like everything is 50+ years old in a good way."

Group trip","The interior of John’s home is new and very pretty. Beds and sofas are comfortable and the kitchen is well stocked with the usual amenities. If you have young children, it’s a good choice because there isn’t any clutter and can easily be baby proofed with a portable gate for the stairs. Unfortunately, the furnace was not working, so it was a bit chilly when the temperature dropped on our 2nd day there. However, John was very responsive and communication was good. He sent a technician over within a couple of hours of contacting him and they were able to get it fixed by the next afternoon. It was about 24 hours that we were without heat, which impacted family coming to visit with a baby.
John brought over space heaters which we personally weren’t comfortable using, but it was a nice gesture. We felt a small refund would have been appropriate for the trouble, but overall we enjoyed our stay and would consider this home again."

The kitchen is spacious and beautiful and properly stocked with pots, pans and utensils. The bed is so comfortable. And I loved having Roku tvs. It was so easy to log in and enjoy all of our favorite shows while unwinding in the evening.
My only negative experience and this has nothing to do with the hosts/house, mayflies (I think that’s what they are called) were horrendous!!! We were unable to enjoy the outdoor spaces at all because of the swarms. We found ourselves running in and out of the house to the car. Several even got into the car while packing up and took forever to get out.
All and all a wonderful stay at a beautiful home filled with so many thoughtful amenities! Would absolutely stay again - probably not around this time of year though!"

The master bedroom was huge! There is plenty of room for six adults.
We loved enjoying the fireplace and I loved the sunroom. The Airbnb is just a few houses down from the lake, so you can see the lake from the kitchen.
Although it was too windy and chilly to enjoy the back porch, we look forward to coming back next summer."

It was Memorial Weekend and we were able to have some family over (some were in wheel chairs) to have some good family time. Corn hole, propane fire pit, and very comfortable outside seating. Mornings were greeted by chirping birds and one morning a beautiful deer came walking through our yard. The place was very clean and mattresses for all of us were comfy and we all slept. There were little corners in the house that you could hide from others or come together for a card game or meal. I really enjoyed our time at this house."

It was beautiful, functional, spacious, included all the little things to make it feel homey and welcoming, and the outdoor space was the cherry on top. We wished the weather would have been more accommodative to enjoy the luxuries of the lake and its surroundings but would highly recommended to stay here to anyone.

The kitchen was well equipped and they had any toiletry you may have forgotten at home. Great outdoor seating on the porch and patio. We didn’t use the bikes but there are three beach cruisers and a cornhole set.
It was a quick walk to the water where there were beautiful sunsets. Just take the steps slow!
Great location to downtown Ashtabula and short rides to the surrounding wineries.
The communication with Amy, the manager, made everything smooth with check in and she made sure all our questions were answered."

Group trip","We were hoping for a perfect getaway with our family, and we sure got it! We simply loved being able to walk and bike to the beach. Pickleball was an extra special experience, and we're convinced we'll become pros! The beach was remarkable, and Sam had everything you needed to enjoy the day! The neighbors were sweet, and biking riding on a calm lake street was something we don't always get but simply loved. The sense of community was really felt as we embraced Bridge Street. The shops were perfect and the restaurants were so excellent! I picked up a beautiful bracelet from a local artist. Truly... it's exquisite! Sam created a home that detailed everything a family or couple would need. The bedding, swings, decor, and furniture were impeccable! Her attention to detail and design are superior. She truly thought of everything you could ever need. It made our stay so wonderful, we can't wait to plan our next trip. Thank you for thinking of everything and making our trip wonderful! ❤️"

We loved being able to bring our dog, the fully equipped kitchen and being close to Bridge St. And while pet friendly the house was super clean. The lake is close but it still was about a 15-20 minute walk so it was a bit further than we thought it would be. It was a nice area, although some of the neighboring houses had a bit of a creepy vibe with their decorations (skulls, demon deer, hangman’s noose). Great stay overall and we would definitely stay again!"

Stayed with a pet","Megan's place in Ashtabula was amazing and magical! Every corner hides another treasure making us wish for the weather turn to awful so that we might discover more. The kitchen, dining room, sitting room and bedrooms were perfectly sized, and the decorating style and amazing color combinations were just so, well, soothing and a feast to the spirit. I don't know if this area of our country has a ""style"" but this very well could be IT. I really need to come back to enjoy the game room and definitely need to enjoy the bath tub in the back garden which was also heartwarming
As the weather was gorgeous, we had to head to the shoppes on Bridge Street which were delightful as were the restaurants. The beach at Walnut /Park was perfect for a morning and evening stroll to see the sunset and just right waves. I was treated to a perfect Sunday morning sunrise when I went down to the harbor to see both the drawbridge rise just as the sun was rising. The beach, shoppes and restaurants are within bike or walking distance. The neighborhood was friendly and welcoming.
A dozen or so wineries are in the area. Geneva on the Lake was close to enough for a visit. Beach parks are located every couple of miles.
A truly wonderful place to stay. And as if all this isn't enough..... I truly felt that bringing our dogs with us was perfectly ok. Some of the AirBnb say its ok but don't really welcome pups. And the homemade grape jelly was a sweet treat! Thank you."

The street is very quite and not busy at all! In the evenings we enjoyed putting up the garage door up and playing games in the game room, and there was barely any traffic when we did that. The kitchen has seriously anything you would ever need for cooking and all the condiments. And we loved the fact that there were beach towels, beach bags, & sand toys for my daughter, and tubes to float on in the lake. That was so nice to have!!

And we used the converted garage for a play room during the day and game room when the kids were in bed.
The hospitality was great. Meeghan was very communicative and promptly answered our questions.
Not only is the house exactly as described, but it's essentially an art museum. Every furnishing is authentic, and it's clear that each piece of decor was chosen (or repurposed) with careful thought. I couldn't recommend this place enough."

As a family of five, there were so many things we appreciated that we had not experienced in other homes. From cleaning supplies, an accessible washer and dryer, paper towels, dish soap, ice cubes and cold water, etc. Those necessary items made our trip so much easier and relaxing.
The area of Ashtabula is beautiful, clean, friendly, and accommodating! I grew up in southern, Florida and I found the beaches of Lake Erie to be WONDERFUL!
My husband and I personally loved the artistic beauty of how perfectly decorated this house was. Just sitting and enjoying the personalized pieces of art and furniture was so neat! We cannot wait to stay here again!

Stayed with a pet","Charming and unique home within a short walk to Walnut Beach. This home is full of eclectic decor and artwork. Large master bedroom with desk, second and third bedrooms are small yet cozy. Open dining room to living room for games, reading, etc. Our family had a wonderful time even though the weather was cold and snowy. Very responsive and accommodating hosts who have done an amazing job making Point Break a relaxing getaway. Our one regret is that the weather wasn’t warmer - we would have spent more time in the garage-turned-rec room, which is flawlessly decorated."

Very clean and in a fantastic location that is either a 1-3 minute drive or walkable to both the beach and dining/shopping downtown. Suspect Meeghan/Ryan may live next door, so appreciated their proximity to resolve issues if needed (we didn't have any!), but absolutely felt we had the home and outdoor space to ourselves for a birthday weekend getaway. Appreciated being able to bring our dog and will definitely be back!"

You can walk down to the lake a few feet away. The cabin is right on a park so there is a paved walking path, playground for the kids and swings to sit and look at the lake. Very close to all of the attractions of Geneva on the Lake. All the basics were provided inside the cabin. I enjoyed making a fire in the outside fire pit under the full moon. Perfect get away."

Stayed one night","We had a nice stay at Bob and Reama's cabin. It was very clean, communication and check-in were easy, no hiccups at all, etc. This is a good choice if you are in the Ashtabula area and need a reliable place to stay. Many businesses were closed due to this being more of a seasonal destination, but we were easily able to find anything we needed within a 10-15 minute drive (if not less).
That said, the cabin didn't quite hit the mark for us. The location is a bit awkward - surrounded by gravel and overlooking a baseball diamond, with Lake Erie technically visible but certainly too far to be enjoyable from the porch. There was no kitchen table (TV trays were available), the sheets and blankets were very thin over an uneven mattress, we were unable to find any provided bath soap or shampoo, and the water heater was too small to take back-to-back warm showers.
None of these items are dealbreakers since the cleanliness and newness of the property offset some of the weak points. But hopefully this helps others know what to expect!"

Stayed a few nights","Cute cabin with beautiful views of Lake Erie! It was an extremely comfortable stay with cozy accents in the whole place. The sunset views from the front porch can't be beat. While there are a row of other cabins right next to it, it was very quiet and most of them were vacant so it felt very peaceful. No direct access to the lake, but there are plenty of places to sit in the park right there to look at the water. Beaches very close by."

Stayed with kids","Amy’s place was in a great location! You get a beautiful lake view by walking down the lane, but there isn’t any way to actually hang out by the water there. You have to walk down a very steep gravel path to get to the water edge and then it is just a steep drop off. Plan to use it for BEAUTIFUL sunset views but head over to walnut beach or breakwater beach to hang out and rock hound at the water.
The decor here was so light and airy, and Amy had so many thoughtful touches around the house.
We did have an ant issue that she was super responsive to helping with, and really that’s my only complaint and that’s a random nature thing for this time of year. It just made it hard to use the cute little kitchen the way i had hoped to. She had traps dropped off within 30 mins of my message though, and that was awesome.
TLDR: great views, great decor, great location, close to local beaches, very responsive host with my issue!"

Started getting settled in and found a coffee bar with everything included, puzzles, games, headed back towards the rooms and found baskets with anything you could have forgotten.

Amy’s place is spacious, clean, on a quiet street with lake view, her decorations are lovely and makes it feel like home. The outside area in back and in front are great for relaxing and enjoying the outside.
Kitchen has everything anyone could need and there are many toiletries for anything you could think of needing. The beds were extremely comfortable and we got good sleep. There is a front room, living room and kitchen for sitting areas. Outside in back a fire pit and grill and nice grass backyard. We loved our time relaxing here."

Stayed with kids",Amy’s place is fantastically cozy and she has it set up really beautifully. Lovely welcome with the local wine. :-) We made a mistake about our check-out date and she and Ashley were incredibly understanding and helpful about it. Highly recommend!!

Stayed a few nights",Amy’s property is exactly as you see in the pictures! Beautifully decorated and wonderful views of the lake. We watched the sunsets a few nights we were there. Quiet neighborhood and so close to Geneva on the Lake. Amy left us wood for the firepit and a bottle of red wine from Ferrante. We enjoyed our stay. It was a great stay besides the spider webs all over the back patio and by the front. Other than that it was great and Amy was very communicative!

Stayed a few nights","We can’t say enough about staying at Amy’s adorable cottage. With more amenities than were even listed, we were pleasantly surprised. The beds, and linens were wonderful, and the outside seating areas were more than we needed, but we loved them all. We would stay here again; the peaceful, quiet neighborhood and being so close to the lake was spectacular! The neighbors were so kind, also!!’"

Stayed one night","I've stayed at a lot of Airbnb's and have never felt so welcome from an owner! There's so many extra amenities to make you feel at home, we were even left a bottle of wine to enjoy! The location is perfect if you want to be away from GOTL but close enough to go there or the wineries. The view is beautiful stepping out of the front door to see Lake Erie. There's really nothing extra you'll need to pick up if you forgot something. Amy has you covered from toothbrushes, to a first aid kit, even allergy medicine! Communication is top notch if you have any questions too. The bohemian vibe at the cottage is so cozy to curl up in any of the rooms and relax. I will definitely be back to enjoy it again! I can not say enough good things!"

Stayed a few nights",This house was beautiful. We were well accommodated and Amy made everything easy and simple. She gifted us with a bottle of wine on our first day at the house! Our coffee pot was leaking on our second day (I'm pretty sure my girlfriend does not know how to make coffee without a keurig lol) and Amy answered me quickly and brought us another one! She went out of her way to make sure our stay was perfect! Will definitely be revisiting!

Stayed a few nights",This place is made of textured boho dreams! The attention to detail doesn’t go unnoticed! The location was great - steps from Lake Erie! A quiet neighborhood minutes from GOTL and Ashtabula. Close to do many cool wineries and fun stuff to do! The neighbors are very friendly too! Communication with Amy was a breeze! Would love to come back when it’s warmer to enjoy the outdoor spaces! Even though Lake Erie was frozen and it was cold and rainy we were nice and cozy in this awesome cottage!

Centrally located, so we were able to visit both Geneva-on-the-Lake and Ashtabula. The views on the front porch were beautiful, and we were able to enjoy both breakfast in the morning and cocktails in the evening on the patio set. Thanks, Amy! We hope to be back again!"

Stayed with kids",What an adorable little gem this was! It was the perfect place for our weekend getaway…the attention to detail was so amazing…from the beautiful decorations around the home to the cabinet full of toys and games that was such a wonderful surprise for my kiddos. A sweet little gift was left for us when we arrived along with items to make breakfast the next morning! Thank you Amy! We will be back!
