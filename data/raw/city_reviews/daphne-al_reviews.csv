Stayed a few nights","Great accommodations at a reasonable price. Close enough to restaurants and attractions on both sides of Mobile Bay. The condo was clean and nicely decorated and exactly as described in the listing. It was the perfect size for just one person. Great recommendations for things to do and places to eat, too. Easy check-in/out. Would definitely consider staying here next time I’m in the area."

Stayed a few nights","Condo was in a great location and was clean. Took us a few minutes to find the exact unit though, but maybe we just misinterpreted the directions. The unit has a strange bathroom layout in that the toilet area is a step up from the vanity area so bring a nightlight if you go to the bathroom during the night. First night we had no issues at all. The second night however, the neighbor upstairs was walking heavily/stomping across the floor constantly from about 10:30 to at least 12:30 (confusing since it is such a small unit) so we were unable to sleep and then I never fell asleep after that until after 5am after more heavy walking around 4 am. No other reviews complained about the upstairs neighbor so maybe they had a guest in their unit?? I tried to read to relax but could not get bedside lamp to work. Bree was kind enough to mail back my pillow case after I left my pillow there and was sympathetic to the lack of sleep and planned to talk with the neighbor."

The host was a pleasure to deal with, quite responsive and cheerful. Pretty tranquil setting - the complex is surrounded by woods and close to the bay. The coffee bar was to die for. There is a step up to the toilet and shower in the bathroom, not shown in photos, and you can hear footsteps occasionally from the occupant(s) above."

Stayed a few nights",This was such a cozy spot! The studio apartment was centrally located for my visit to Daphne & Fairhope. I had everything I needed and the bed was comfortable for this side sleeper. I thought it was an excellent deal! I would say if you are older and need support going up stairs there is no railing on the few steps coming in and there is a step up to the toilet and tub (with support within reach). It has a large tub and I wish that I had made time for a soak.

I like the nice bathroom with the heat control in the ceiling for when you get out of the shower. I sat out on the patio and watched the pouring rain with her scented candle. Everything was awesome. She even left me a condolence gift for me and my mother, which was two pair of earrings. Along with a sweet card. We were in town for my stepdad’s funeral and she made it stress free after everything with the burial was done. Thanks again Bree. You are a sweet lady and a beautiful soul. God bless you."

Stayed over a week","Holly is an amazing host! She was very responsive, provided everything you could need & more!! The apartment is in the perfect location...in a quiet, pretty neighborhood, but still right in the middle of everything! I was at this location for a month...felt like a home away from home. I couldn't have asked for a better host or location. Thanks again for everything, Holly!!"

The kitchen was amazing and had everything we needed to prepare our meals. The game room and back yard are the stars of this home and the kids loved being able to have a fun space and utilize the fire pit for s’mores! The inclusion of bug spray, a lighter, wood and starter fluid made our night possible. Beds and sofas are extremely comfortable, bathrooms were clean and well stocked and the master bedroom has the best ceiling fan for those who like to stay cool. A/C works very well to keep the home comfortable and the inclusion of laundry and dishwasher pods was very helpful. Parking is located on a hill but levels out for walking. Lastly, the host is amazing and his communication level is top tier. We were grateful to stay here and can’t wait to come back!

The weather was perfect during my stay; I was able open the sliding glass doors and curtains that overlook the golf course to let in the crisp air.
All flooring, countertops, and appliances have been updated, making it feel like a new condo. The location was quiet and tranquil. The complex is minutes away from local dining in Daphne and Spanish Fort. I-10 is less than five minutes away if you need a quick means to get to Mobile, AL or Pensacola, FL.
I will definitely revisit at a later date."

Robin went above and beyond in making sure this cozy condo has everything you might need. We loved the balcony, the comfy couch and big screen TV, the coffee bar, the night stand with built in charging station, and the blue-tooth speaker connected to the bathroom vent fan. Robin thought everything through so perfectly when designing the space with guests in mind.
We can’t wait to stay again!
Note: Although your GPS may direct you differently, the unit is easier to locate by entering from Yacht Club Drive off US-98 and turning left into the property."

The only hiccup was locating the exact unit because GMaps took me to the entrance of the condos as the final destination rather than the actual unit number, and I arrived after dark. I messaged Robin asking for help and she responded within minutes with a map of the complex. It was a breeze with the map. Will book again when I’m in the area. Thanks again!"

I want to express our heartfelt gratitude for being such an amazing host during our stay in your beautiful cottage in Daphne. Beverly was in contact with us even before we left the UK to make sure we had everything we needed.
The coziness and comfort of the cottage made our experience truly memorable. The town of Daphne, and its wonderful people, added an extra layer of charm to our visit.
Being greeted every morning by the local cat, Tippy, was a delightful touch that added to the overall warmth of our stay. Your attentiveness and responsiveness made us feel incredibly welcome, and nothing was too much trouble for you.
We highly recommend your Airbnb to others and look forward to staying with you again in the future. Thank you for creating such a wonderful experience for us.
Warm regards,

I asked the owner to allow me to cancel all the same or at least get a partial refund, but she wouldn’t budge. It was get right, yes, but she could have met me half way.

Stayed a few nights",Beverley’s place is lovely. She provides all the comforts of a home away from home with little bonuses like wine and chocolates and bicycles that can be used during your stay. We enjoyed it so much and fell in love with the neighborhood kitty that greeted us with snuggles each morning. We will be back!!

If you want a beautiful vacation or small weekend retreat for soul searching this is it . Don’t look no further , this cottage should be your only destination. I will literally daydream of this vacation for years to come ."

It may be a little difficult to find if it's your first time there (especially in the dark) but don't let that dissuade you. Once you're there you'll be able to find it no problem.

Very quiet and relaxing although it’s so close to everything….. There was a festival going on the weekend that I was there just down the street and I didn’t realize it until I left the driveway and saw the cars lined up on the side of the street. Such a peaceful atmosphere!!!!! I will plan my 2022 visit around the availability of the Little Cottage on Main Street. Beverly is such a wonderful host and so welcoming!!!! Thanks a million Beverly and look forward to seeing you in 2022!

We were suppose to arrive on the same day as Hurricane Ida, but Beverly allowed us to come a day early and ride out the storm in the cottage that had everything we needed for a few days of wind and rain. There were many special touches like homemade cookies and fluffy blankets. The kitchen was very well stocked and the bed was super comfy. The cottage was off the Main Street so very quiet. 150% choose this cottage if staying on the Eastern Shore."

She also has another small deck with comfortable outdoor furniture where we also loved to unwind at the end of the day.
There is also a separate living room with 2 chairs, a loveseat, a table and a tv. The bedroom is separate with its own door and a bathroom. The bed was very comfortable. Everything was so clean.
Beverly has a stylishly decorated space. She was so thoughtful and left us a bottle of wine and some fresh bakery treats from a local bakery. Beverly was so friendly and I am glad we stayed there!"

Stayed a few nights","Wow! This little cottage is perfectly named and appointed. They have anticipated everything you’ll need and provided it in advance. Each room feels spacious because every square inch has been used thoughtfully, leaving plenty of space for storage and floor space to move around. For instance, the bathroom is has a pedestal sink and no ledges around the sink. But they’ve added a small storage unit above the toilet that should hold all the necessary amenities you bring. The bed and other furniture is very comfortable, including the porch furniture. The quality is even better than I expected. Beverly is very sweet and responsive. Overall it is a great home away from home! I can’t wait to stay again."

The shower was warm, the towels were soft, the bed was comfortable, and all the little details were taken care of. One morning, we rode the supplied bicycles and found more hills than we expected 😜. We also walked down to the water at McMillan Landing.
To sum it up, this is a good base for exploring the surrounding Eastern Shore area and also a nice place to stay in or take quiet walks in the neighborhood. We look forward to returning!"

It was cozy and quaint and hosts had so many little touches that made all the difference- bottles of drinking water, travel size meds and bowl of chocolates. We were happy to have a toaster oven as it's our primary appliance we use and love.
The view of the water and peacefulness of all the mature trees and nearby Macmillan Bluff was just dreamy.
There was this little sound that was distracting to me at the start- my husband had to really strain to hear it. I figured out it was the fridge and we put some low music on and after the first night it didn't bother me.
We had a relaxing and quiet and restoring time together. Just what we needed.
Thank you!

Located in a quiet and beautiful neighborhood located next to a scenic bluff, you have an amazing view to watch the sunset and see Mobile, AL across the bay. Troy & Susan answered any questions right away and seemed quite friendly even though we actually never met them. If I ever come through Daphne again, I will be booking this property."

Stayed a few nights","So much nicer than staying in a hotel. We felt so spoiled being this close to the bay. The bed was comfortable, the towels were so soft and the whole loft was very clean. Check in and out were a breeze and the owners were so helpful to answer any questions we had!
Sitting on the deck reading books and walking down the little nature trail to the beach access across the road was the highlight of each day of our stay. The sunsets over the bay were lovely!
We ate at East Shore Cafe three times...Totally recommend! Other wonderful places to eat nearby are: Moe's BBQ, Whit's Frozen Custard, El Rancho, Wacky Shrimp and Guido's.
Also...visited the local park boardwalks, B&B Pecan Farm and enjoyed the wildlife and birds during a day trip down the eastern bay coast on Old 98.
Thank you to Troy and Susan for making our first AirBnb experience addicting. We pray the stars align in the future to be able to stay here again!"

Had a great weekend at this Airbnb in Olde Towne Daphne. The loft was very clean and the owners were always responsive. Perfect location near the Mobile Bay with access to everything around us within a 30 minute drive. We loved the porch and enjoyed sitting out to watch sunsets and the stars. Easy access to the property. The neighborhood is very quiet and the loft had a great AC and ceiling fan with cozy decor and even some little accessories you didn’t remember to pack. The Keurig coffee machine and kitchenette were great. Enjoyed nearby Fairhope and Point Clear. We took a short drive over to Bellingrath Gardens and walked the beach on Dauphin Island. We would stay at this property again."

We had a great time exploring the daphne area as well as Fairhope which is just down the road. The cleanliness, the amenities, the charming neighborhood, the overall value is much better than any Airbnb I’ve stayed at. I can’t express this enough.. if it’s available, stay here!!"

There’s a mini kitchen, that we did not use only because we ate seafood out every day! Nice touches and the deck is great! You can see the bay and it’s lovely to go for a run along the mobile bay. The loft is close to an awesome wine bar, about 0.8 mile walk. It’s also close to a great yoga studio that offers great classes. There were snacks and water left for us which was a cute touch as well. We will be back!"

Great location can get so many places we wanted to visit within 1 hour or less. Just a couple of recommendations for meals: Ruby Slipper for brunch and Felix's for dinner. You will not be disappointed in the resturants or the beautiful studio. Thanks Jim and Deb for sharing your lovely airbnb.

The area was very clean and the bay behind the condo was beautiful especially at sunset. I 100% recommend this for you if there’s just two or three people on your trip (:

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely loved staying in this studio! Jim and Deb were great communicators and made sure we were happy with our stay. The studio had everything we needed, including bottled water ready for us in the fridge, phone charging outlets by the bed, and a coffee pot with coffee! We loved sitting on the back porch to enjoy the breeze and view of the water. The bed was comfortable and the studio was clean. Would definitely recommend staying here! Also loved that it was within walking distance to a bar & grill!"

Stayed with a pet","We had nine people and two dogs that stayed at Tammy's place for my graduation. Everything was as described. If desired, it can feel like two separate houses with the two living rooms, two kitchens, and two washer/dryers. Kitchens and rooms were fully stocked with everything we needed. As with anything with multiple stories though, be aware of sounds coming from the second floor if you are staying downstairs. Also, there is only the master bathroom downstairs so if someone else is staying in the second/spare bedroom, they will either have to share the bathroom with those staying in the master bedroom or go upstairs. We totally enjoyed staying here, we appreciated the Christmas decorations as it made it feel even homier. Parking was ample and the place was easy to find. If we are visiting Mobile and Tammy will have us in the future, we would definitely stay here again."

Tammy had been great answering all my questions prior to our visit. Check in and check out instructions were easy. I couldn't have asked for a more accommodating host.

However, after driving over 10 hours, I wouldn't have thought we were needing to wash the linens and towels. The upstairs island and kitchen along with the utensils wasn't cleaned at all. The floors were filthy. But... on the brighter side of things, Tammy had responded quickly and we were refunded our cleaning fees but I would have liked to be reimbursed for two days out of four because it took the whole family to clean and who wants to do that on a vacation? I like to be pampered while being on vacation."

Stayed a few nights","Loved The Retreat. Spacious, awesome closets, comfortable. We were in town for our daughter’s wedding so it was nice to come “home” at the end of the day. Wish we’d had more time to use the patio and hottub. Maybe next time when we’re in town and not so busy."

Stayed with kids","This place was perfect! The house was exactly as pictured and described.
It was immaculately cleaned and well stocked with everything we needed.
The extra touch of having coffee available really made such an impression for us.
The other extra things provided like laundry detergent, starch for ironing, shampoo and other bath essentials made our 5 day stay a lot less stressful. (We were in town for a family wedding.)
Plenty of towels, pillows and extra blankets.
The size of the house was perfect for our family because there was plenty of room to spread out. There is a comfy breakfast nook or a large table in a different room.
The covered patio with fans and a large TV made our evenings at the house even more enjoyable. We felt very at home from the minute we arrived.
Tammy was responsive, friendly and very helpful when I had questions.
We will definitely stay here again when we come back to visit family!"

Stayed with a pet",this place was perfect for us. we visited family in the area and even brought one over (that was in a wheelchair from the nursing home) to watch the game with us. Plenty of space and everything you need. Beds were comfortable and everything was clean. we really enjoyed the outside area. location was great and a short drive to fairhope and many different restaurants. I would definitely stay here again. We were happy to find a box fan since we forgot ours. I did bring my pillows from home but found the pillows there were even more comfortable 😌 really enjoyed our stay.

Stayed over a week","Tammy‘s home was very comfortable for a week plus stay to visit with our Daphne family. Every time I looked for a convenience, Tammy had it in place. Well stocked kitchen, laundry facilities, fenced in backyard, where we could sit comfortably with our pups.
The home is in a quiet walkable neighborhood. I loved the unique organization of bath towels in baskets in bedrooms and powder rooms!
This house is as pictured, with large rooms. Multiple areas to eat, read, watch TV. Tammy has earned her superhost status, responding within minutes when we had questions and making sure we had no issues with reservation, finding and entering the property. We will definitely seek to stay at her home for future trips to the area!"

Perfect to have two bathrooms. The hot tub was a wonderful way to end every evening when we got back to the house. The backyard space is an added bonus! The one thing that might be of concern to some is two of the beds mattresses are soft. Other than that , there was nothing negative. I would definitely stay here again!"

She allowed me to check in early due to no one renting the day before. When I arrived, she greeted me, remembered my circumstance, and even offered to go get any extra tables or supplies. Not many hosts would do this!!! My parents absolutely loved it. I think my dad stayed in his pajamas all day until wedding duties called him out, and my daughter in law ordered door dash for her, her 2-year-old, and my parents. Definitely recommend this house!"

Stayed a few nights","The house was as pictured. Cozy and comfortable, and able to host just a few folks or a big family dinner. The beds were just right.
The kitchen was great for light meals and 4-5 people. Anything more involved needs more utensils. We didn't see anything kid-sized for eating ware. We enjoyed using the grill in the back.
The couch was SO comfy! Once you get snuggled in, it's hard to want to leave. Especially when you have a good book.
We don't recommend putting the fan on in the room with the bunk bed if anyone is sleeping on the top bunk. Our boys loved the beds and the cool steps up to the top.
Tammy had all the baby stuff you could need and one of the rooms had a great selection of children's books."

Stayed one night","We are from the area, so we already knew this place was going to be perfect...and it was! This home is so centrally located, and close to everything you could, or would want to do in Fairhope, Daphne, and Mobile. This sweet house is quiet, it was our sanctuary after a long day of visiting friends and shopping. It was genuinely nice to come home to a quiet reprieve. The beds are comfortable, the house is clean, the kitchen has just what you need to cook at home. There is a laundry room, if needed. We had a great sitting porch on the front with rockers as well. I really enjoyed our time here and would absolutely seek out Austin's place again when we come back for another visit. We absolutely loved it! Thank you!"

Stayed with kids","We were first time Air B & B'ers. But the communication with Austin was easy and he was very responsive. The house was CLEAN and 🚫 bugs. Honestly, that was my biggest concern since we've had stays in hotels/condos before that was subpar when it came to cleanliness. I loved how he provided filled bottles of hand soap, paper towels, even extra toothbrushes (if needed). The TV had lots of choices of what to watch on it, minus the Auburn game but maybe he's an Alabama fan so he had the channel permanently deleted 🤣. There's even boardgames for the kids to play on too. My only negative comment i would have for the house would be the beds. I believe they were memory foam beds and more on stiffer side than I would prefer. My husband has back problems so it was great for him, but I prefer more plush. But honestly, you can't make everyone happy when it comes to beds since personal preferences varies so much. All in all, it was a great, clean, and affordable house to rent. We highly recommend!"

Finally the place is updated and furnished very well. It has easy access from the front and back porch and it is a side unit so it is private feeling.

We had everything we needed and more. Our host was so accommodating and if we had questions he was prompt to answer.

Stayed with a pet","I don’t even know where to start!
Dwight (Dain), provided an extremely comfortable place for my family and I.
He accommodated to all our needs! (we had 2 dogs, 2 cats, and a newborn baby!)
He is very knowledgeable of the area, and is close-by if anything arises!
The condo is perfectly situated against a green-belt, and he’s got private shades on one porch, a smoker, and a grill out back to use!
It’s conveniently close to Publix, gas stations, food, EVERYTHING you need. It’s right off highway 10, so it was very convenient for me to get to Mobile for work (10min tops).
Has 2 beds, 2 bathrooms, a dog gate if you need it. A full functioning kitchen with a toaster/coffee-maker, a washer and dryer that functions perfectly, and a very comfortable living room. 100mbps internet, perfect for work/streaming!
We felt very safe during our stay as well, with spot lights surrounding the entire property if you were to walk around it.
I can’t thank Dain enough, STAY HERE! You won’t regret it <3"

Stayed with a pet",Dwight was such a great host. He lived near by so we communicated often. He was very nice and accommodating. The condo is close to the water and has Kayaks to use. I will certainly stay again. Very clean condo and open. Bed very comfortable in the master bedroom. The condo has a great setup for families or friend's traveling together since there is a lot of privacy for the bedrooms and bathrooms. The master can be closed off completely . Just a great setup. The condo has outside sitting and cooking areas. The location is ideal setup since you are close to everything and very convenient if your coming off interstate. Very quiet but close to eateries and shopping. Just a great stay!

It’s very nicely decorated and comfortable. We took a walk each morning around the neighborhood which we really enjoyed.
The hosts were very responsive.
The only downside was we could hear the neighbors walking around upstairs, and music next door. It wasn’t bad enough to give this place 4 stars, it was just a minor annoyance when we were trying to relax.
Overall I would recommend this Airbnb and stay here again."

Kyle and Amanda have truly thought of every detail to make your stay comfortable and are one of the few hosts that deserve the title of “ super host “! Everything was clean, new and well maintained ! From the amazing, fully stocked kitchen , to the fluffy extra blankets , all the little extras made their place just like home ! We have been AirBNB guests for many years now and this stay was one of the few BEST stays we’ve ever had ! They have set the bar high for other hosts ! We were spoiled and it was so welcomed during that difficult time we were going through !"

So when I had to come back for a week this time, I made sure to see if he had an available unit and luckily he did. Both of the condos were great, and it makes being away from home a lot easier when you have a great place to stay. The setup is wonderful, and all the little extra things really make it feel like a home. After these two trips I’m not sure I can stay in a hotel anymore. Thank you so much, Joel!"

Stayed a few nights",Joel was friendly and professional from the start. The week before going down he provided driving instructions into the condo complex as well as using the key lockbox to obtain the keys to the condo. The condo was just like the pictures and not once did I hear a neighbor. The Keurig was a nice added touch as well as the provided coffee supplies. Unfortunately I went to have some beach time but Mother Nature thought otherwise and ended up leaving two days early because of the weather and continued forecast of storms. I didn’t ask for a refund nor expect one because Joel obviously can’t control the weather but he graciously provided a refund for the unstayed days. I would stay again and would recommend the place for one person or a couple.

There were multiple stores close by, restaurants and Mobile Bay. The condo was a short drive to Mobile, Fairhope, Orange Beach, Gulf Shores, Dauphin Island and many more attractions/cities. We were able to visit all in our short 4 day stay.
Joel himself was awesome. His communication and instructions from booking through post check out was superb. He typically communicated first and responded within an hour if I messaged him. He was open to suggestions and left a great welcome packet with emergency info, places to go, shopping and anything you needed to know.

Some things to note.
Glass above door lets light in at night, enough to light the room up slightly.
AC unit is loud and kicks off abruptly.
Shower water pressure is low, but that may change.
No dedicated kitchen table chairs.
Loved my stay here and would suggest it to anyone!! Thanks for a great first AirBnB experience!!"

The details and thoughtful amenities made this place really stand out from other places I’ve stayed. Loved the location and all the recommendations, the bay view was the perfect addition to my morning or evening runs. My biggest complaint when I stay places is usually the bed because I feel none are as comfortable as my one at home but I couldn’t even tell the difference which is amazing!! I definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting daphne or even surrounding areas as everything is just a short drive away."

Stayed a few nights","If there is a silver lining to our Hurricane Ida story, finding Joel’s condo is one of the shining threads. While searching last-minute for an evacuation spot from New Orleans, we were able to book this charming getaway. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to land.
Leaving behind the conveniences of home was not as difficult as it might have been, as the condo had all the amenities that appealed to our aesthetic sensibilities and creature comforts. The layout of the condo is well-designed and the space was tastefully decorated. We especially appreciated having the private back porch (with sliding screened glass door), the no-issues WiFi, the king-size bed, and the perfectly-sized kitchenette with a roomy refrigerator. Not to be taken for granted was the the parking space conveniently located near the front door. But the icing on the cake was the proximity to the bay. What better way to end each day than a 5-minute walk to watch the colors of the setting sun emblazon the sky as it melts into the horizon?
As a host, Joel was extremely attentive, responsive, and accommodating. Considering the situation, he made us feel welcome and comfortable at a time of great uncertainty.
We hope to make it back one day, preferably next time under more relaxed circumstances. What a gem!"

Stayed a few nights","It's our first time to visit Daphne. The studio was perfect for me and my husband during our 3 night getaway. Location and cleanliness tops our satisfaction. The place have the basic amenities we need, wouldn't trade it to a hotel room. Joel was quick to respond to our inquiries and we can tell he's a great host. Would stay here again in the future if given a chance."

Stayed about a week",Joel's place is in a great location to get to so many places locally. He has thought of most things and left good instructions that answer most questions. I found Joel to be very responsive too. I think that my favorite part though was the porch. :)

Stayed a few nights","For starters, the style of the room is so cute! nice, open, chic look to it! the unit is ideally located.. it was a short drive to both Fairhope and Mobile. We were able to explore around different neighboring cities without driving 30+ minutes! It was also really close to the Bay!! The unit is ideally located close to the interstate, so any day trips or fast routes are accessible! Joel had great suggestions on things to do and places to eat! Everything was clean and well-stocked! we had a slight issue during our stay, which was in no way Joel’s fault or within his control, but he was super accommodating and willing to hear my concerns! he stayed in touch with me throughout our stay to check in on us! Joel was quick to respond and eager to help in anyway! we would definitely stay here again!!"

Stayed a few nights",This place was an awesome get away for me and my wife. It was our “mini” honey moon and we couldn’t have picked a better place! Joel was so helpful and accommodating. He even helped me surprise my wife with roses on the night of the wedding. It was very clean and the bed was super comfortable. If we are ever down that way again we will definitely be staying there. We were his first couple to stay in his place and it was an awesome experience. I highly recommend checking this place out if you want somewhere affordable near Fairhope.
