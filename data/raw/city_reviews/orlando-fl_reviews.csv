Yromira always replied right away from when I first rsvp, very friendly. the space was as described, definitely cozy and cool. bed was super comfortable!

The only downsides were that the wifi was spotty. Not a huge deal for me, but my partner was playing online games during the day and sometimes had to use his Hotspot. Also, there was still trash in the bin. It was only one or two things so that didn't bother me too much. For the price, I would definitely stay again. The host is really nice and great at communicating."

Stayed a few nights","The place was comfortable and location was super convenient and place was a great price. Had a major issue with wifi though. Did not work all 4 days I was there. Also he had a soap dispenser in the bathroom but there was no soap in it, but he did provide bar soap that was stolen from a resort. The dishes that were provided seem a little dusty which was gross. Also one of the days he had a party at night playing super loud music and there were screaming kids. As a guest looking for peace, cleaniness, and wifi, it was an unpleasant experience. The owner was nice and communicated and I would probably stay there again if these things were fixed."

The bus station is literally in from of the house and that’s a thing if you’re going somewhere. You can walk to the mall and there’s a lot of places to go from there. Also very close to the airport and it gives you the privacy that you need and you don’t share with anyone!!! That’s amazing!

It felt very private with its own entrance and I loved the sunny patio area. I felt very comfortable and safe here - neighborhood is within walking distance to a few stores so it's perfect for grabbing essentials and food. Also not too far from the airport, which is a huge plus.
Yroima was a great host - great communication if you needed anything but also respected personal space and privacy. Exactly what I was looking for. Would definitely recommend to others traveling solo and would love to stay here again the next time I'm in the area!"

Stayed a few nights","This home is very charming, beautifully decorated and very clean. The bed is incredibly cozy. The shower is spacious but the water is not very hot, only warm, it's a shame in the cold.
The welcome was very brief, our hostess seemed to have people at the house, the walls are thin and we heard everything as if we were there. However, she was very responsive by message and was happy to answer our questions.
Dishes are provided, there is enough to make a meal for two, but then nothing to wash everything. If you plan to eat multiple times at the home, this may be a problem.
The place is close to the airport, a bus line passes right in front, and you can also go to amusement parks by Uber for cheap."

We were flying in and out of Orlando for a wedding about an hour away so we spent our first and last night staying here and it was so nice to knock out just 15 minutes from the airport (especially because we landed close to midnight!) She was so accommodating about our late night arrival and made sure we made it safely both nights :)

Stayed a few nights","Overall, this was a cute little Casita! It was extremely quiet, there was enough coffee and toilet paper (I've been to places where there wasn't enough TP and had to buy my own). Christie had left some snacks and water and all the things you might need during your stay.
The only cons, in my opinion, were the window in the bathroom and the bed. There was no shade. It felt a little uncomfortable to shower. And, the bed was too soft for me.
Other than that, it was a great place. Christie even offered us to take our time checking out, but our flight was leaving fairly early so we couldn't take advantage of her offer. :(
Thank you, Christie!"

It was very peaceful and the bed was comfortable. The neighborhood is very safe. It's in close proximity to all the Orlando attractions - malls, Disney, Universal, etc. Although the size was perfect for me personally, it might be a squeeze for more than 2 people but zero complaints. I highly recommend this place."

Stayed one night","Christie’s place had such cute decorations. Since it’s just a bedroom and bathroom, it feels small at first but honestly it was just perfect for the two of us. We were just exhausted and needed a quiet, clean place to sleep and sleep all night. So we didn’t use the lovely patio or any of the mini kitchen set. But the bathroom had great water pressure and a shower head that could come down. And Christie has nice signs all over explaining things and pointing out tips for the room."

The neighborhood itself is peaceful and quiet. But the property apparently is directly below flight patterns in and out of the Orlando airport. Bring earplugs if that will help.
Even with that, I would happily return and recommend staying at Christie's Airbnb. She is a lovely host."

Stayed a few nights","Christie and Evan are Super Hosts for a reason. Before I arrived I asked questions and they offered suggestions on beaches. When I arrived, checkin was easy and instructions were clear. As a minimalist this place had everything I needed: a bed/bathroom and coffee maker, microwave and refrigerator. when I asked for much needed beach items for rest and relaxation, they provided them in a timely manner. A clean place 5 mins from a conference I attended. I was able to come home between sessions for lunch and relaxation. The bed was comfortable and towels soft.
I do not use the toll roads when coming to Florida. The beach was about an hour and 20 mins away with no toll roads or freeways. I went Cocoa Beach, to the 16th street beach. Non tourist and free parking. Later I went to Cocoa Beach Pier and ate at Pier 62. Great atmosphere with locals & cruse ship and regular tourists. If you are looking for a mom and pop shop for food, I recommend Jack and Mary’s in Orlando."

Christie's place was exactly that. It was very peaceful and comfortable. We loved the extra touch of the beautiful patio space with lovely lights and a cozy blanket. It made for a great late night reading space. The space was on the smaller side which for someone who loves to organize could have been a struggle but it suited our needs well and had a lot of amenities packed in. It was definitely a good value and we would certainly stay again.

Christie is definitely a cool one. She was always attentive to needs that may be emerging in the process. The place was really comfy and clean. The back of the apartment was one of my favorite things."

Stayed one night","What a gem! This place was quaint and perfect for my husband and I. I was so impressed with how at home we felt. Christie thought of every detail and even had chocolate cookies waiting for us in the Casita! If you forget any toiletries, she has them for you! The mini fridge is a great amenity too! We had trouble with the sliding glass door when it came to locking it. We eventually got it but christie was more than willing to help if not. The bed was a little hard for my liking but that’s a personal preference. A memory foam topper would have made it even more heavenly. Overall very satisfied with our stay. Close to a lot of great places. Next time we’re in Orlando we’ll make sure to book the Casita again! 5 stars!!"

The host was great and made sure we understood how to get in and get out."

Christie really knows how to make a small space work. The lovely decor, super soft towels, and extra amenities were a plus. I've stayed in bigger bnbs that barely provided enough dish soap. I highly recommend the Casita!"

Her thoughtfulness is evident in every detail, from offering beach supplies to complimentary tabletop smores. She knew it was my birthday and even went so far as to get me a cupcake. Made my entire weekend. Needless to say, I would stay here again in a heartbeat! Thank you again Christie!"

Stayed a few nights","Alba's unit was wonderful. Nicely remodeled with beautiful flooring, state of the art shower and comfortable recliners. The bathroom was very clean with unique features. Such as a LED lit touchscreen mirror that doesn't fog up, large rainfall showerhead with wand. Shampoo, body wash, shave cream, q-tips and more were provided. The towels were the softest I've ever used. ( I looked up the brand and will be buying for my own home) I had a 3 hour flight that very turbulent so no food or beverage services were provided. I walked into the unit parched and hungry. Alba provided a few bottles of water and crackers as a complimentary snack! Just what I needed to hold me over before I went to dinner. Only complaint I have was every now and then the water pipes in the bathroom would start to make a whiney noise randomly. Turned on the sink and flushed the toilet to fix each time. Not a bother at all. I didn't explore the neighborhood at all. Would rent again."

The studio exuded a sense of cozy sophistication. The decor was tasteful and modern, with thoughtful touches that made me feel right at home. The space was impeccably clean.
One of the highlights of my stay was undoubtedly the location. It is literally less than 20 minutes from the airport. It is also near many restaurants, attractions, and shops. The studio was surprisingly peaceful, offering a tranquil retreat from the hustle and bustle.
The host was responsive and accommodating. Overall, my experience exceeded all expectations, and I would wholeheartedly recommend this Alba's Guest Suite to anyone looking for a cozy and convenient place to stay in Orlando, near MCO. I certainly hope to have the opportunity to return in the future."

The space was bigger than I thought it was going to be and everything was as described. The wifi was fast and the A/C unit worked great. Alba was super friendly and responded to messages I sent her. The location was nice being close to the airport and the drive to both Disney/Universal was about 25 minutes. Obviously the nightmare of I4 traffic may change that, but that is unavoidable when visiting those parks. Definitely recommend staying here if you are planning on spending your days fully at a park and need someplace to come back to sleep and shower at."

The outside of the apartment is not within view of the street and under surveillance which added to my sense of security. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay there again."

So many additional toiletries were left for us , so nice , such a sweet touch . I really loved the quiet neighborhood and it was a comfortable neighborhood to take a run in. I felt very safe. The location was very close to food, shopping , even universal and Disney is close.
I even forgot my shoes at check out and she quickly sent me a text and I was able to come right back and get them before I left town. I will stay here again for sure. Thank you 😊"

It's 15 minutes away from the airport, you can take an Uber or lyft. Super near from International Drive. Space is super comfortable. it had utensils, pots, seasonings, a microwave, and a mini stove. it has a mini fridge where you can place your leftovers. inside the room, everything was super clean and neat. in the closet, you have hangers, an iron with its ironing board included. In the bathroom she provided toiletries and towels. Again, this is one of the best places I've stayed. Alba was very responsive, kind, and attentive. I will come back for other commitments I have planned over the next month's. Thanks for all the good hospitality."

Alba is very nice, she replaced my used towels with clean ones. She replied quick and even accepted the Amazon package for me. It was a great place to stay in. I would love to book her place again when I return to Orlando. Definitely worth the price I paid for. Thank you so much, Alba!"

Its DEFINETLY worth its Money! The instructions to get in the studio are very clear and the host respond quickly and proactive.
So if youre gonna miss this, its your own fault."

This was the perfect place to unwind after the hustle and bustle of a theme park before flying home. It was a small space, as advertised, but so cute and secluded. The view out the windows was so peaceful to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee. The hot tub with twinkle lights overhead was so calm at night after a long day. We stayed with our toddler, and the host put out some toys for him that he was so excited to see and play with! Also the home was a half hour drive to many of the Orlando destinations. The only thing that was frustrating was that the neighbors were quite loud that night and although it didn't bother the toddler, it did wake us up a few times. But I know it's hard to control that! We just didn't expect it. We really enjoyed staying here!"

It can get a bit chilly at night, but there is a space heater and the AC runs well in the heat of midday. It is a more rural area so signal is not great, but WiFi is available. Not the fastest speed, but we weren't there to be on our devices anyway. Overall, would recommend!"

The sun roof does make the room extremely bright in the morning…so I recommend bringing a sleep mask if you’re planning on sleeping in (: LOVED the location and everything about it !!"

Stayed one night","what is a Yurt you may ask... like I asked when I saw this Yurt on the Air B n B site under interesting places to stay. I was so excited to come see and stay at this yurt. Paul's yurt was more than I expected!! I recommend this quaint and beautifully serine and adventurous yurt to everyone! Immaculate/Quiet/Romantic/Serine/Natural/and Exhilarating!
We wish we had booked for Two nights... maybe next time?!?
Paul was proactive in communications and in making us aware of his hospitality and availability. The Uber Eats dropped off our food to his door instead of the Yurt door (even though we gave directions to come past the houses to the Yurt). Paul walked the food down to us. ☺️ this was a TOP NOTCH Air B n B and Experience! We give this Yurt the A++ Seal of Approval!! Thank you Paul (and Mrs. Paul) for this Extraordinary Experience and sharing your little corner of the world with us!
Thank YOU!! God Bless!!
We will be back and we will tell everyone about this Hidden Gem!"

The room is simple and comfortable, with GREAT PILLOWS and a delicious bed. The area offers a variety of restaurants and cafes, and is great for walking, renting bikes or scooters, and using public transportation, making it easy and inexpensive to get around the city. However, there are some aspects to improve: the air conditioning was a little old and noisy, the buzzing stunned me and I was sick, the shower had a strange configuration that could be uncomfortable for tall people, and the shower curtain had mold. I hope you can arrange this. Also, it is important to note that the room lacks windows other than the front door, which may be relevant for those in need of additional ventilation. For me. it was good. Despite these details, I definitely recommend this place!"

Easy check in/out and Joey was very friendly and prompt in responding to messages. We were there for an event uptown and didn't have too much time to explore the local area but did manage to have a few meals nearby, which were excellent. Highlight was meeting his dog Jackson, so sweet and friendly, a very good boy who made our day. Will absolutely stay here again next time we come to Orlando."

He keeps everything organized to make things easier for us. The places are very close, very much walking distance if you don’t mind getting your steps in. The local recommendations joey left us were great as well. The neighborhood is safe and sound, very peaceful even at night. There wasn’t a small thing there that I could complain about, it was very comfortable staying there and trustworthy! Definitely booking this spot again when I come back to florida :) hope you enjoy"

There are restaurants, cafes and bars within walking distance, very close to Lake Eola and everything in the downtown Orlando area. Parking was easy. The courtyard was lovely to enjoy the comfortable Fall weather. The suite is perfect for a single person or couple. There was a small fridge so we could keep cold drinks chilled and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay."

One of the reasons I picked this particular place over the hotels downtown or close to the parks was for the location, it's in a safe and friendly neighbourhood, I was walking distance from restaurants, coffee, a beautiful park (lake eola) and much more. As a solo female, who loves to walk everywhere, it's important for me to be somewhere where I can walk and feel safe. Joey was a very friendly, attentive and accommodating host and Jackson was a cutie."

Stayed a few nights","Perfect spot for 1-2 visitors. The location really can’t be beat. Joey was friendly, communicative and accommodating. Meeting his sweet pup Jackson and one of his cats, Twilight, was a highlight during our trip. :)
The suite itself isn’t huge, but it has everything you would need. There’s street parking if you have a car and we never had an issue finding a close spot. Joey’s backyard area is very zen — you can tell he takes care of his place and wants his visitors to feel at home and relaxed.
Thornton Park itself is a picturesque and charming area. We had bagel sandwiches from Eola General for breakfast and did a jog around Lake Eola. Wish we could have stayed longer because there’s so many more food spots and bars nearby that we wanted to explore! If you book this place, take advantage of this lovely, walkable neighborhood."

Stayed one night","This was more than I expected for an Air BnB! they knocked it out of the park with this residence, there's a fence that keeps you secluded enough but everything is within walking distance. I didn't know where to start when I got hungry with all of the places, but there's a lovely list of recommendations right in the room. I forgot soap for he shower and I thought I was SOL, but then I hopped on an electric scooter (rentable and are everywhere) and there was a seven eleven less than 5 minutes away that I could've walked there. All in all a lovely residence with excellent bars and restaurants nearby. they also have a mini fridge with water in it as well!"

Stayed a few nights","The neighborhood and property were very nice, private, welcoming. The space was smaller than I thought but worked well, efficient, not feeling cluttered. The older/weathered style furniture is nice but hides dirt/stains and such. The surface of the only desk was sticky, spotty. Bathroom was nice, good shower. If you stay here, the Shampoo and Conditioner is on the shower floor ledge, between the 2 oversized curtains... they 'hid' from me the entire trip!
The Bed was very nice, hard to find with my bad back. Clean linens, cool A/C, smart TV, fan, more than enough lighting. Overall for the price and compared to hotels around, it was a great deal and a nice experience overall.
I was able to walk over one block away and watch the Live UFC fights outside the Bars/Lounges on their outdoor TV's and watch people dancing through the front door of the other spot just across the street :)"

The neighborhood is beautiful, feels super safe and the cottage is in a nice garden, where you have enough privacy and can also sit outside.
Inside, it's just as nice: a good bed (including enough firm pillows) , nice shower, and everything clean.
Joey is easy to reach and responds quickly to messages. If we were ever going to Orlando again, we would definitely stay here again!"

I think its important to mention in abundance of agency managed properties on airbnbs, it was refreshing to have the personal touches and flexibility of a single person hosting their personal property as AirBnB intended. My fiancee and I enjoyed our stay."

The neighbourhood is charming, peaceful and a close walking distance to a variety of local restaurants, bars, spas and salons— Just about everything you would want really close by! Joey was easy to reach and provided a warm welcome and recommendations. Jackson, the Goldie and kitty’s made it feel like home! The suite was clean and comfortable, ideal, for solo traveller like me. The only thing missing from the cottage, in my opinion, was a coffee maker. Admittedly, a coffeeholic I am…and to have had a fresh cup in the morning, without having to go out to visit a cafe, would have made it that much better. 😊"

We tried opening up, turning off air conditioner and not using the bathroom fan as they both seemed to make it even worse. There were 3 room spays/linen sprays in the room that we used but only worked to blend with the smoke smell for a few minutes. We even tried our faithful trick of whole coffee beans in a bowl. Nothing worked for us. Unfortunately, it even came home with us and I have been working to get the smoke smell out of our clothes, luggage, and even a fabric craft project I took with me."

Having access to a washer and dryer was important not only in planning a head as far as what and how much to pack, but also allows me to get a head of the cleaning and washing when going home.
The area is up and coming. While the area is mostly peaceful and quiet during the day, the foot traffic does pick up at nights on the weekends. However, that would not deter me from booking again."

Stayed a few nights","The unit is very cute and well equipped for such a small space. We do have a few complaints, there are two bathroom doors that interfere with each other, it would be helpful to please remove one of them. Unfortunately our stay was during a very hot time in August. The AC could not keep up in the late afternoon and we had trouble sleeping each night until things cooled down in the middle of night. Also, the bed pillows should probably be replaced. They are thin and a little lumpy and worn out. Lastly there is a smell of cigarettes when you first arrive, you get used to it but each time you leave and return again it smells very strong. We were able to handle it but a highly sensitive person would find it difficult. The location was great and overall that was why we chose this unit. We highly recommend Hawkers Asian Street food just around the corner and the free parking across the street was very convenient."

The host gave us a candle but it was still pretty noticeable, not their fault and something that I’m sure is rectified already. But was present and potent during our entire stay.

It’s close to several wonderful bars, restaurants, and shopping and is also just a short ride from local attractions like the Winter Park Scenic Boat Tour, historic Park Avenue, and the Winter Park Farmers’ Market. We’ll definitely book Yana’s place again the next time we’re in town! Thank you for a great stay!"

Stayed a few nights","The mattress was probably the best part of this place! Definitely memory foam of some sort so you’re not waking your partner up if you turn in your sleep. Firm, but you still sink right into it. You’re just off mills so you’re super close to a LOT of shops and restaurants etc. The fridge/freezer is very spacious! The kitchen area has all the silverware, dishes, paper products, etc that you could need. The AC is easy to adjust as needed and the TV is easy to use as well. It’s a great stay especially if you’re planning to do activities in the downtown/winter park area."

Yana and her co-hosts were great communicators giving me plenty of information as to check in and check out. The place was super clean and the amenities were better than expected. The only thing that worried me a little is the available parking is in a designated parking lot but on one of my nights that lot was full so I had to park in a different one and I was worried I would get towed. I did not express my parking difficulties with Yana as I was okay with just dealing with whatever happened. All in all it was a great stay! I would definitely recommend staying here!

Stayed about a week","The Airbnb was okay, and is accurately represented in the photos. The bed is big enough for two people. It’s not very spacious, however it was big enough for me and my partner. I liked the layout of it, they did provide us with soap, a hair dryer with attachments, an iron, etc. We had some difficulty with the ac/heater unit and it not blowing out hot air, so it was pretty cold during our stay.
The parking is across the street, however it is connected to what I believe is a popular bar. So when we would arrive back from doing activities after 7pm, it would be pretty difficult to find a spot. We had to circle the lot a couple of times on certain nights. I think the area was generally ok, but was in a busier spot.
I would recommend staying here, with the exception of those two things I think my stay was fine."

Stayed a few nights","I really wanted to give Yana’s sweet guest house 5 stars, but unfortunately I can’t due to a few reasons. The location and cleanliness of the place was great; however, I ran into a few issues while staying there. The AC unit does not make the place very cool, and according to a light that was on, I think that the filter may need to be cleaned/replaced. I wish that had been kept up with because Florida in July is HOT. Then on my second day, I was blow drying my hair with the dryer that they have there and it tripped the breaker for the entire guest house. I messaged Yana and it took her a bit to respond as she was out. Meanwhile, it got extremely hot in the house and I was in the middle of trying to get ready with no power. Finally she responded but then I had to wait another 20 mins (close to an hour total without power) for her husband to get home to fix it. Thankfully he was able to. The morning of my last day, I ran out of the only roll of toilet paper I could find in the house, which wasn’t even a full roll when I check in. I messaged Yana asking if she could bring out some more and unfortunately did not hear back until after I checked out. I’m not sure if I was supposed to stock the house with TP myself, but I didn’t feel like I should’ve had to. I could be wrong. I also feel like if you run an Airbnb, you should either have a property manager (or whoever) in charge of all the communication so that it can be done in a timely manner, or the owner should constantly be on top of messaging back and forth in case something is wrong. Otherwise, Yana seemed sweet during communication when I first booked her place and the guesthouse itself is super cute and in a safe location. One last thing is that there was no dish soap to be found, so I wasn’t sure how to wash the few kitchen utensils I used. The space provided paper plates and plastic cutlery, so once I noticed that, I used that instead. But unfortunately the dishes attracted some ants, even thought I tried to wipe them clean with paper towels in the meantime."

Location : probably the best location I’ve ever had. Especially for my age group, there are two bars within 50 feet of the place where you can get drinks and takeout.
Neighbors : Super friendly and inviting. They had great recommendations on food.
Food : go to seven bites but make sure you get there early, there’s always a long wait.
Parking : we came at a bad time, Friday at 6 PM so the parking lot was very full and I had to wait for parking. No biggie for me, that might be an issue for a larger family. The parking lot is directly across from the Airbnb."

There is a parking lot across from it but it can get busy so we parked on the street next to it. We felt safe leaving the car there since it is off the main road and residential."

Stayed a few nights","I really enjoyed the space and the location. There were awesome bars with great cocktails within walking distance. Parking was across the street and free. I was a little weary leaving my car there overnight (at first) but everything worked out really well. I will say that the place is quite small, and would be most ideal for 1 person. Two people is what I would recommend at MOST! Even a small child (with a couple) would push you over the max. The shower is small, but will get the job done. The bed was a great sleep (my partner disagrees), firm but memory foam that made it really comfortable. Yana was really easy to get a hold of and the in unit laundry was a great asset. In all, I’d definitely recommend this place and it helped make my trip that much better."

We did sit out by it many sunny days in the afternoon and it was very peaceful. The house, kitchen & bathrooms didn't feel old or dated."

And I’m with my family and 2 dogs. I immediately booked Karins place without having to wait for confirmation which was important on a Friday night in central florida. Got to Karin’s I think 45 minutes later and it was perfect so clean and the water was hot! Not much to ask for lol. Getting her place really made my weekend, was able to invite friends and family over, and the fenced in yard was perfect for my dogs. Don’t make my mistake and do it right the first time! Ty Karin"

Stayed with a pet","We loved our stay! The place was very clean and had a fenced in yard for my pups. We didn’t use the pool because it rained most of the time, but it was a nice feature. Would stay here again for sure…
A few non-deal breakers to keep in mind:
-at night the ducks sound like they’re murdering each other. I’m used to living in a loud area so this wasn’t a deal breaker. Just took me by surprise.
-bring shampoo/toiletries. The small amounts they provide were only enough for one day. Again not a deal breaker since the stores are nearby and we could buy some.
-the master room bed was not very comfortable and may have a hole in it.
-my dog found old/moldy dog treats in the yard. There was also some poop left behind from previous guests. (Again non deal breakers but be aware in case you step on it.)"

Stayed a few nights","If I could give this place a 10-star review, I would.
Katies and Scott's apartment is not only quiet, but also has every comfort that travelers need to recover from things to do in and around Orlando. From the fridge to the blinds on the windows to the air mattresses in the super clean and amazingly deep swimming pool - everything is chosen with love and super clean.
Both the airport and the attraction in and around Orlando are easily accessible by car. Possibilities to have breakfast and dinner are also close. If you have any questions, the landlords are always available; there are also helpful tips in a manual to find your way around Orlando and the really beautiful, idyllic neighborhood (restaurants, supermarket, etc.).
We would book the accommodation again at any time. We only lovingly call the pool house ""Barbies Dreamhouse""."

You can’t beat the privacy of the pool house and back yard with the walkability and proximity to downtown and the theme parks. We walked or rented scooters and barely drove our rental car (parking in the driveway was a huge bonus) to get everywhere we needed. We come to Orlando every October and will certainly plan to stay here again!

Stayed a few nights","My husband Tony and I had a wonderful honeymoon stay at the Livingston pool house. It was immaculate upon arrival, fully loaded with all the essentials needed at this type of stay and comparable to items a hotel would provide plus more. They even welcomed us with a beautiful basket of personalized items, including a Mr. And Mrs. mugs which became momento from our honeymoon. I actually found experiencing the ambiance and vibe to be better in person when you see it all together. While it was the backyard of this lovely couples home, it was truly a private oasis and they made our stay as comfortable as possible. The parking spot was great as we rented a vehicle for our stay though not needed for the area since it is walkable. Katie provided recommendations for restaurants and they were all 10/10. I highly recommend that if you stay here, plan to have a few days to chill at the house as you won’t regret it. There’s nothing more you could want. Thanks again for a perfect stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Katie and Scott’s place was just how it was listed, very private and quiet. It was very easy to locate and to gain entry, Katie and Scott live in the main house but they keep their back blinds closed to it makes the pool house very private indeed. The garden area in beautiful, lots of seating areas and if we had stayed longer we would have made use of the pool and the bbq area. The pool house was very well equipped with everything you need, the bed comfortable and a lovely shower room. Nearby you can find some local shops for food and around the lake we found a nice restaurant and a great wine bar that does nibbles aswell. You are also only 20 mins away from downtown and the main streets with lots of bars and restaurants. We meet Scott one evening with his small dog in the front garden, he was very friendly and told us about a rocket launch the next morning which we would be able to see from the garden, we were up to watch it, we couldn’t see the rocket but saw the vapour trail."

The space was clean and inviting. The kitchen space is bare bones- a sink, mini fridge, Keurig and microwave, but the grill enabled us to cook a meal or two. The whole place was light and airy. Comfy bed and nice shower for those folks who are wondering.
Highly recommend going to the Lake Eola farmers market on Sunday, pizza at Anthony’s and a foot massage at Heavenly Foot Massage!"

The surrounding area was amazing and so peaceful. There’s a beautiful park just a few minutes down the street that we really enjoyed. We truly enjoyed every second of our stay, thank you so much again Katie & Scott!"

Stayed a few nights","This is the kind of Airbnb where you feel 1000 % the value of using the platform vs staying at a hotel. The pool house has it all! Location, design, cleanliness, the warmest hosts, a beautifully landscaped garden and a refreshing pool!
To have such a private place all to ourselves was an optimal retreat. We didn’t want to leave the poolhouse. We enjoyed playing ping pong and lodging around. Of course we were surrounded by attractions such as Lake Eola, restaurants and lovely homes in a most walkable neighborhood. Getting to downtown was a short, enjoyable walk. If you are looking for a great place to stay while in Orlando, look no further. I would much rather stay here vs the Disney resort we stayed at while visiting the Disney World.
10 out of 10. Best Airbnb we have stayed in."

The pool area was beautiful. It was very private and felt secluded, we got way better sleep here than we’ve ever got at a hotel. We never saw or heard the hosts, which was great. But the best part is the location… it’s basically perfect. You’re five minutes walk to several restaurants, then 10 minutes walk to Publix and like 15 more restaurants, and then an easy 20 min walk to basically all of downtown Orlando. And we did walk all over, we felt safe at all hours (walking back from downtown at 2am), the location is just perfect."

Stayed a few nights","If you have any doubts or reservations about booking this place for your trip to Orlando. Do yourself a favor and slap yourself for me, and book this place right now. This place is absolutely INCREDIBLE!!
I booked the pool house as a romantic and fun getaway for me and my girlfriend on our tenth anniversary. As soon as we opened the private entry side door to the backyard and got our first glimpse of the pool and pool house. We both looked at each other like we had struck gold. It is so pretty, private, relaxing, and well designed. It really felt like walking into our own private oasis, and this is before we even opened the door to the house. We were both giddy with excitement and couldn’t stop talking about how nice and beautiful everything was. The pool had a wonderful seating area and the fountains were such a nice touch. That gave you the calming sound of running water.
We made our way to the house, opened the door and immediately fell in love. The house is sooooo cute and made us feel at home instantly. Katie and Scott have thought out every single detail to provide the best experience possible. Everything you could ever think of needing they had already provided you with. Me and my girlfriend have been raving about this place to all our friends and family ever since. We can not wait to come back and book this place again the next time to come back to Orlando. I almost didn’t want to write this review, because in a guilty way I want to keep this place all to ourselves.
Couple highlights from our trip that really stood out about this place.
Pool shelf seating and floaties
Ping pong table and hammock
Luxurious and sizable bathroom
Ring toss game
Outdoor couch seating for poolside dining
Walking/biking distance to amazing bars and restaurants. (We really liked tin and taco)
Comfy bed with all the amazing thoughtful considerations provided by the hosts.
We had such a great time that I asked my girlfriend to marry me on 7/11/21. We took a hot air balloon ride with painted horizons tours on that morning, got down on one knee and popped the question. She said yes 💗💍😁!!
Can’t help but think this Airbnb helped seal the deal. Thanks Katie and Scott. Can’t wait to come back. Hopefully next time we get to play with your super cute doggo.
Thanks again
-Mike and Briana"

We walked to dinner, the lake, the grocery store - easy! But let's get down to business...the private POOL is where it's at. I wish I had a day in Orlando just to hang out by this pool...forget Disney, grab a drink and sit poolside, grill something up, play a round of ping pong (yes...there is a ping pong table), read a book on the hammock and chill. And inside! Katie and Scott thought of it all. I mean, they even have nice towels! Honestly, just stop reading my review and book. Enjoy!"

Katie and Scott even provided us an extension cord by request so we could more easily work outside :) It is worth mentioning that there is a small table for two inside as well for another work spot. There were tons of great food and bar options within walking distance, and other cool areas like Winter Park were just a quick drive / Uber away. When relaxing we really enjoyed the shallow area in the pool which was great for reading with your feet in the water, the hammock, ping pong table, and nice outdoor patio/seating area. Katie and Scott were very responsive, had great local recommendations, and even had some some birthday cupcakes waiting for us when we arrived. We would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","10/10!! You will regret not choosing this Airbnb! We loved it from the minute we walked in. Katie and Scott were so helpful from the beginning when I noticed their guide book filled with places that were hits for us when we visited, not to mention they were all within walking distance. The pool house was so refreshing and immediately felt like our little home away from home - a great spot to come back to after long days exploring universal studios and Orlando! Anything we needed, Katie and Scott were so quick with their replies. We stayed for 5 days - a few days were chilly but we had no problem cozying up on the patio after dark with the hanging lighting, such a cute touch!! We hope to be back some day."

Stayed a few nights","This place is SO lovely and comfortable! Exactly as described. I never saw the owners but they were quick to respond. Even though the main house is right there it felt private. Everything was clean and stylish.
The outdoor space was a beautiful oasis! Unfortunately, we didnt have great weather and we were there in beginningof February so the pool was too cold to use. The space got great sun from 11am until about 3pm.
I would highly recommend this place to any individual or couple."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and me stayed here for 5 nights for our Orlando theme park visits. The pool house is the perfect getaway home! It is in quite neighborhood. At the same time, it is minutes away from Orlando downtown and there are so many good dining options around (Hawkers Asian street food and Taco Cheena are our favorites!) And it is about 25 minutes drive to Universal studio.
The weather during our stay is a bit chill so we missed the chance to enjoy the pool. But Katie and Scott are so accommodating that they even cleaned the pool after a rainy day in case we would like to use it. The sofa and bedding is really comfy so we can really relax after a long day in the theme park.
We would definitely recommend everyone to stay here for your Orlando visit!"

Stayed a few nights","Wow. You will be very happy with this spot. It’s basically it’s own resort! The design and layout are awesome and the atmosphere chilling in the pool chairs is so relaxing. The other reviews below mention quite a bit, so I will just add a few of our particular favorites...The water under the pool chairs is at the perfect level so your butt doesn’t get wet if you just want to dip your toes in!
The shower is big enough for 2 people with plenty of space and a good sized bench and the cutest custom design on the drain. Oh, and the towels are very plush & heavy duty and feel wonderful.
And the piece de resistance: (2) hotel luggage racks!! People always forget that you need somewhere to leave & work from the suitcases!
And since we didn’t have time to fully enjoy everything there is in the yard, we will be back!
Thanks!"

Stayed a few nights","Without a doubt one of the best places we could have stayed for our visit to Orlando! Being a private couple we weren’t sure how we’d like being in someone’s backyard oasis, so we asked. With quick responses from Katie - we booked the Pool house right away- so glad we did!! The pool was wonderful, but from start to finish our stay well exceeded our expectations...
Upon arrival we were greeted with the cutest entrance, definitely impressing on us that our visit would be and feel private. The pool itself was inviting, clean and looked so fun (tested & approved!!) As we entered the pool house it was apparent this couple took pride in their space, the decor lent you to feel at home and relaxed. Place even smelled fresh & clean. We enjoyed the welcoming gift, water and snacks(THANKS). Nothing about our stay felt rushed. This was much needed!
Overall I’d say this was one of the best places we’ve stayed.
*If you decide to book - we highly recommend you take advantage of the close proximity they are to restaurants & the park. Everything really is a short stroll away. In addition they were a short driving distance to The Plaza Live, where we saw Shakey Graves. The east end market, where we lunched and picked up our fav Lineage Coffee and lastly a few minutes from some neat shops we try to frequent: The Owls Attic & Dechoes.
Thanks again for a great weekend!

But you know, if it looks too good to be true, it usually is so we tried to be prepared for just some small disappointments. No need to, it was as amazing as you hope it is and more. The house is so very nicely decorated, so many attention to small details, a very nice bed. We did not leave the house for a day because we liked it so much. Thank you dear Katie and Scott for having us as a guest. It was the best Airbnb we ever stayed. And will stay is my guess........... #foreverspoiled :-)"

Stayed a few nights","This is one review I'm apprehensive about writing, because I want to be sure there is always availability for ME! Selfish, I know.
The pool house was a like a dream getaway with perfectly exceptional decor from the moment you walked to the first entry door. It's very secure, was spotless (that white couch!), and lots of windows, a/c, fan, tons of tv-watching options, and a bed you won't want to leave. We even received a sweet welcome note, and a special Floridian sweet gift.
It's outfitted with everything you need, even a few snacks - how thoughtful is that.
As for the location, it's in a very clean, quiet, quaint part of town with well-cared-for surroundings.
The hosts are the best I've experienced at communicating, and fast too. So kind and gracious.
The only regret I have is we didn't spend enough time so that we could use the pool. It's really inviting to say the least. Anyway, we will be back soon.
Thank you Katie & Scott
(THE BEST AIRBNB WE HAVE EVER STAYED IN...that's the truth)."

There was never time to be bored with the game room, the gaming systems, the theater room, and the pool! The beds were SO comfortable!!! The kitchen was well stocked with very nice appliances and cookware! We couldn't have asked for more. And the owners....WOW! They were SO responsive and helpful. When our Walmart order came earlier than expected (before our arrival), the hosts went to the house and brought in our groceries and even put the cold items in the fridge! You can't ask for more than that! Staying at this house alone was a vacation in itself, but if you are in the area for Disney like we were, it was such a quick and easy drive. The kids loved the bunkbed rooms with the slides and the Mario Kart room so much, they were ready to leave Disney and get back to playing at the house! You can't beat that!!"

As two families of five, totaling six children ranging from 6 to 14 years old, finding a place that caters to everyone's needs can be a challenge, but this home surpassed all our expectations. The kids were constantly entertained - so much so that they preferred spending time at the house over going out to the town or visiting theme parks. It became a highlight of their vacation, which speaks volumes about the amenities and environment provided.Chris, our host, was outstanding in his hospitality. He responded promptly to all our questions and made sure our stay was comfortable and enjoyable. His attentiveness added greatly to our positive experience.We wholeheartedly recommend this Airbnb to any family, big or small. It's well worth it for the quality of stay, the exceptional entertainment for children, and the superb communication from the host."

Stayed with kids","It is our goal when we travel to stay in a house unlike our own and experience next level accommodations. This home did just that and then more!
The first thing that caught our attention was the game room. It was like stepping into a miniature arcade, complete with a wide range of arcade games, a pool table, and air hockey. Our whole family had a blast spending time competing and enjoying quality time together.
But that was just the beginning. The themed rooms with slides were an instant hit with our kids. Each room had its own unique theme, from Frozen with a princess castle to Mario Kart. Our kids couldn't get enough of sliding down into their own private play area right off their bed. The attention to detail was truly remarkable.
We spent our nights after returning from the parks swimming and enjoying the poolside BBQ area. Then off to the in home theater to cap off the night!
The Host was incredibly responsive and went above and beyond to make sure our stay was amazing!"

The kitchen was well equipped with pots, pans, cups and plates. there was nothing we needed that wasn’t there, even down to the Bluetooth speaker. Everything was beyond what I expected. There was plenty of towels and washcloths and I’m very picky with linen. Every towel and washcloth was efficient. Nothing at this home was a short cut. The Host was there at every call. I mean the phone couldn’t ring more than two times he answered, and I was very grateful for that. The only con about the home was the pool heating system did not provide the pool and warm but the Jacuzzi was very hot, pool was still cold. Thank you for allowing my family to enjoy your home. Overall, I would rent from them again and again and again very pleased."

The house is pristine. The kitchen is big and well stocked. The arcade and gaming consoles were a big hit with all ages. The theatre room was perfect for football and Harry Potter movie nights.
The themed kids bedrooms are even cooler in person. The other bedrooms were spacious, clean and relaxing after a long day at the theme parks.
It was great having our own private pool. The pool heater worked great and was more than enough heat for our early fall visit."
