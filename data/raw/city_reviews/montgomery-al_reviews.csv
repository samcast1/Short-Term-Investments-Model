Stayed with kids","We have stayed in a lot of AirBnBs over the last few years, and this may've been the nicest, cleanest one I have stayed at. Truly outstanding. The photos in the listing didn't do it justice. The neighborhood was quiet and near grocery stores (which is important to us). And Don was super-accommodating with a request we had. Just and outstanding experience."

He provides a very handy local guide which includes the amount of time to arrive at the destinations. Don is very kind to provide a basket of snacks and beverages in the refrigerator. This lodging is very quiet - no traffic noise, no train whistles, or loud neighbors nearby. Don even provides covered car parking. Don is a great communicator too. If you are visiting Montgomery, this is a fantastic place to stay! I would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed one night","Don's place is quite lovely. It is set up for families and with almost anything you would like (looked like he had a playpen, toys, crossword puzzles, movies, etc. for family fun). He left a basket of snacks on the table and more along with drinks in the refrigerator. It had all the amenities of a hotel but with the feeling of being in someone's home. :) The only thing that wasn't a 10 was the pillows on the bed. They were pretty fat and I'm more of a down-filled pillow person. But that is me. I would stay here again! The price is great for such a lovely place to stay in a quiet neighborhood. Thanks Don!"

He was so quick to answer.......We got into town and hour early asked if we could check in and pay the difference and Don without hesitation said IT'S READY FOR YOU NOW AND NO EXTRA COST... That is rare in these days. Got tho the house ( is so eay to find) the neigherhood is so peaceful and like you are at home. Got into the house ( easy peasy) and what a treat it was so nice , inviting, and warm ( well cool, it was hot / muggy but not inside..LOL) they really did offer so many nice things..snacks on the table as soon as you walked in the door kids toys ( my grandson had a blast with every one of them) to drinks stocked in the fridge THANK YOU we enjoyed them..... :) Oh and I have never stayed at an Airbnb that told you NOT to take bedding off, take trash out, this was a first and a very nice touch."

I can tell you that Don has nailed it with his Airbnb. I felt right at home without a feeling like it was a canned presentation. everything was clean and there wasn't anything you could need that he didn't provide. if you are going to be in his area, stop looking and start booking this before someone else does."

Upon arrival, we were pleasantly surprised to find a refrigerator stocked with beer, coke, and juice, offering us a refreshing start to our stay. The clean and comfortable beds ensured a restful night's sleep, while the decor featuring cotton and origami added a charming touch, reflecting both local heritage and creativity. We appreciated the abundance of local park and travel guides, providing us with valuable information to explore the area. The spacious accommodations and board games made it an ideal choice for families. Without a doubt, we would gladly book again, the peaceful atmosphere and the comfort of the space made our stay truly memorable."

We didn’t have little ones, but it was nice to see options available to keep them entertained if we did have kids. The location is great, close enough to downtown excursions but also within reasonable driving distance of good eats outside the city center. We went to two local places from Don’s book of suggestions, so worth it! Overall, a great stay with clear instructions on check-out process. Would highly recommend and will definitely come back myself, should I find myself in Montgomery again. Thank you for hosting a fabulous place that made our trip even better!"

We didn't have children with us, but the place is definitely set up for families as well as adults, and there is plenty to do inside the house other than watching TV to keep you from getting bored. The kitchen is extremely well-stocked with just about anything you might need for food prep. The beds were very comfortable and there was great water pressure in the shower. We did take a walk in the neighborhood at dusk and felt completely safe and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again!"

The kitchen and fridge were very stocked and snacks on the table. The livingroom was very warm and welcoming with modern furnishings and very cozy.
The bedrooms are very pretty and the beds were very comfortable with soft sheets and warm blankets. Ceiling fans and bedside tables and lamps with plugs for the phone chargers.
Bathrooms are very nice with plenty of towels and everything you need for a shower and qtips for after.
If you have a child, there was a high chair and toys and games.
This was a very lovely place and we look forward to stopping here again if the future allows. Thank you!"

The stay was significantly more affordable than other airbnbs and hotels around, and it was for incredible value. You aren’t compromising anything even with the incredible price. Feels safe as well as it’s near owners property and tucked away on a shared road. Highly recommend!"

They truly thought of things that every guest …from infants to seniors, could possibly need/ want. Don was always quick to respond and went above and beyond to make our travels so relaxing. They left all kinds of snacks and treats …and for weary travelers that was a great delight. We are Airbnb hosts ourselves and we got some great ideas from their shining example! Highly recommend"

It had a first aid kit, toys, movies, books, coffee, drinks in the refrigerator, and snacks. It looks like Don has really thought about everything. The location was great and it was very very safe and quiet. It was very convenient to downtown Montgomery. If we come back to Montgomery, we will definitely stay here again."

Everything was very clean. There were some snacks and drinks there available to us. My husband really appreciated the “guide to Montgomery” book that was there and we went to some of the places listed. My favorite thing was how child friendly the house was. The first thing my girl did was go for the basket of toys! There were puzzles, books, crayons, pack n play, sippy cups, and the outlets were all covered.
The house was so close to everything—the zoo, shopping, restaurants, downtown, and the stadium. It was pretty peaceful at night even being so close to everything.
We would definitely stay again!"

Stayed with kids","Absolutely phenomenal Airbnb!! To say that this Airbnb had everything would an understatement. Don truly thought about the smallest of details. His place was fully stocked. Even with things we would never have expected! We came pretty well prepared but noticed that if we had forgot to bring items, he had them right there for our use! Not only was everything fully stocked, everything was also spotless! Every single room was squeaky clean. Best of all, this place felt like home away from home. After winding down from a long day, we were able to sit back and watch a movie at night and eat popcorn like we were at home. The house was in a great neighborhood and lovely to walk around. It was conveniently located near a Publix and many other restaurants and stores. Also, it was within 15 minutes of sites in downtown Montgomery but enough out of town where it was quiet. I’d recommend this place to everyone and will absolutely stay here again in a heartbeat if ever in the area again! Wonderful!"

Stayed with kids","This location is definitely a hidden gem for anyone visiting Maxwell AFB. We stayed for graduation festivities and we’re happy with how close we were to the base as well as other activities. Everything felt like it was just 5-15mins away. You’re located just outside downtown and about 18-20mins away from the OTS school house…traffic at the gate caused the biggest delay. Local museums and of course the Montgomery zoo are must see items for the kids. Plenty of places to eat nearby and Don also has a book of recommendations for everything. The house is cozy and the pictures are nice, but it looks better in person. Plenty of space for 2 adults and 2 kids to stretch after a long drive and just relax. Highly recommend this property, and owner, to anyone looking in the area."

Located in an older neighborhood, this house has been fully remodeled and was very clean. We also felt safe where we were located.
Having locked ourselves out of the house, Don was quick to respond and had us back in the home within a couple of minutes.
Don had the place stocked with extras. My son liked the snacks that were available. I particularly enjoyed the Keurig coffee maker.
Big screen tv in the living room stocked with DVDs and we were able to enjoy Pirates of the Caribbean to relax after a long day.

Stayed with kids","AMAZING! I cannot express how awesome this place was but, I will try.
1. It was SO CLEAN! I had a crawling baby with me and I felt 100% comfortable having him go everywhere. It felt like it was basically a new build hahaha
2. There was so many sweet touches from the snacks they left me and my kids to the labels everywhere so I wasn't confused by anything, to the drinks in the fridge.
3. KID FRIENDLY! They had coloring books, baby toys to little kid toys, they had little kid books, they had a pack-n-play and even a HIGHCHAIR! It's pretty difficult to find an AirBnB that has amenities for kids and this one seemed to have them all!
4. It was also amazing for adults! The TV was HUGE! There were also a ton of puzzles, movies and all different kinds of books.
It was truly an absolute joy staying in Don's place. He was very sweet, welcoming and communicated well and quickly. I would love to stay here again the next time I am in town. It was a blessing for me and my family."

The place has everything you would need (2 full bathrooms was a big plus!), and our kiddos appreciated the toys. The neighborhood is quiet, safe and very convenient to local restaurants and grocery stores. We would stay at Don’s place again and recommend it without hesitation!"

Stayed one night","We gave a 4 star because this couple is trying hard to renovate and are trying to grow an area of their town. The listing stated ""garden District"" yes it is officially in the garden district but that is very misleading as this area was in a very much disrepair. The listing stated restaurants and shopping within walking distance . I never found anything in a 4 block area and I would not walk anywhere in that area. They reached out to us after booking to tell us the bathroom tub was peeling but it was late and we didn't have anytime to get a new place so we just sucked it up. The blinds were dog chewed and needed replaced . The beds were very nice and the unit was clean to my standards . The check in was a key left under a rock. The doorknob lock was the only lock on the flimsy back door entrance . The deadbolt did not work. Again I did not feel safe. Amenities were lacking. No paper towels or shampoos ect. The rooms were large. This was not an ideal place for women traveling alone."

Stayed with a pet","One of my favorite airbnbs - really nicely updated older home in the very walkable Garden District of Montgomery. It’s nice to see older homes getting a fresh start. The character of the house shines through. Beds were comfortable, lots of space. The fenced in backyard was so helpful as we were traveling with our dog. We really did enjoy the game room and used both the ping pong table and pac man! Our main reason for coming to Montgomery was to visit the Legacy Museums - we were only 1.5 miles away. All in all just a great visit for our first time in Montgomery. Definitely go to Dreamland BBQ !"

* Great parking
* Lots of televisions
However, it did have a few issues, such as internal doors not shutting correctly. We had problems turning the heating down. We could only find one spare blanket - more would have been appreciated. We would have loved a book that explained the house rules, how to work the equipment and what is available in the local area (we find this helpful Airbnbs we stay in)."

Julie and Michael were so helpful and responsive. Their listing met our needs perfectly- with king size bed, pack n play, coffee and a safe, fenced yard for my fur babes. I loved the unique layout of the home as well as the way they have decorated it. Hair dryer, toiletries, even laundry machines- this place had it all. I would recommend this listing and these hosts all day long and hope to stop in again on our trips to and from houston/raleigh. Thanks Julie and Michael!"

Stayed with a pet","This beautiful corner house felt right at home. The only differences are that is is huge inside than I thought. The picture show it look smaller. I felt more safe if having a smart lock installed than being responsible for a key everyday. I do not like have to worrying about a key on my vacation. The king bed is one of the most softest bed I have ever laid on and it hurts our back the first night. I had to tell my son to take over and me and my fiancée slept in Queen bed that is firm. It was perfect! My son love the biggest room lol. Those minor things doesn’t defeat the whole experiences. We love it! My two little dogs love being outside, we were out exploring, eating out, and stayed in the room mostly due to living room being too cold. Thanks for letting us stay there. Happy Holidays!"

The house is exactly how it is described and how the pictures look. The house was clean and you can tell the host put time , effort, and detail into their home to ensure whoever stays will be comfortable. Clean linens, clean home, cooking utensils, coffee maker , microwave, washer/ dryer, laundry soap, women sanitary supplies, soap, towels, entertainment for the family ( games and television in each room and a fenced in backyard for our fur baby. I felt at home away from home and I am picky. The beds are also comfortable. I will be sure to book this home anytime I visit home. A unforseen situation occurred on my part and they worked with me and helped me out and for that I'm grateful. If you are in town don't look any further, this is your home away from home."

This property is on the edge of the Garden District and is just a block or two away from the Governor's Mansion. Like most older neighborhoods, there are some houses nearby that need attention, but I couldn't ask for a more peaceful and quiet environment. It is a convenient location near the interstate but far enough away to block any traffic noise. I'd like to come back again when I have time to explore the historic areas in Montgomery, and when I do, I will plan to stay at Julie and Michael's!"

My pup says, ""Hey, wait a minute, what about the floor grate that locked me in the bedroom?!"" LOL. She follows me immediately. I got to the back door and realized she wasn't with me. I went back to find her frozen. Showed her how to exit through the bath and 2nd bedroom. Other than that, she approves wholeheartedly. Seriously, I think we saved around $200 not staying at a hotel with the pet fees."

Group trip","Doug’s home is beautiful and comfortably fit our family of 6 adults. He was very accommodating. Allowed us to check in a little early since we arrived there before check in time.
Before heading to AL, I had asked Doug if the house had a griddle. If not, we would just bring ours. He went above and beyond by purchasing a griddle to have in the house for us to use which was not expected, but truly appreciated. We used it the whole time we were there and I’m sure future guests will also enjoy having.
If we are ever back in Montgomery with a bunch of us together again, we would love to stay there. It is located in a beautiful and safe neighborhood that’s close to a lot of restaurants and even a Costco."

Stayed with kids","We stayed here for Christmas 2022. We have family in Montgomery but wanted our own place due to having two littles and needing nap time etc. This house was perfect. Everything was very clean and exactly as described. The location is close to stores, restaurants and pretty much anything you might need. We loved staying here and plan to rent again the next Christmas we are in town! Doug was extremely responsive to messages and very helpful!"

Group trip","I was pleasantly surprised that the home feels much larger than the pictures. The home definitely has the 'WOW' factor as soon as you walk in the door. It is great for large families. Everyone was able to spread out and have their own private space.
Doug was a fabulous host and very accommodating to our needs. The instructions for access were very detailed and super easy. The supermarket is only a few minutes away and shopping and restaurants are only 5 minutes away.
I highly recommend this home for staying in the Montgomery/ Pike Road area."

Stayed a few nights","Traveled to Montgomery with a friend to play the Robert Trent Jones golf courses in the area. We stayed April 22-26, 2024. The location of the property to I-85 was perfect for us. The home is an older home, which has been very nicely renovated. It is very clean and all the appliances, including the washer and dryer, are brand new. The bedrooms have medium firm mattresses and were very comfortable. There are motion activated lights under each bed and also in the laundry room and when activated stay on for approximately one minute. The backyard is very nice with a swing and rocking plastic chairs.
The only inconvenience we had with the whole stay was the queen bedroom has no plug in for your phone by the bed. This is a pain but nothing that made our stay any less than five stars.
The hosts Suraiya and Jonathan were great. Any question I had was answered in less than 15 minutes. I would stay here again and would recommend this home."

They make our travel days more anticipated than dreaded and give relaxing bookends to long weeks away that only come once a year. If ever your vacation or visits with loved ones do not go as planned, plan to make a ""serenity now"" stop at this sweet backwoods lodge. There is every option for kicking back from a firepit and flat screens to corn hole and rocking chairs on the patio. Its like a family lock in - where everyone can be a kid for a night. We bring a scooter and hoverboard because of the big patio and open floor plan and we always sleep hard after watching movies and chatting around a campfire, recalling the best parts of our adventure or dreaming up the next one. Thanks"

I highly recommend this location! 10 out of 10!"

Every room had so much space and was beautifully decorated. The place was extremely clean and comfortable with every amenity thoughtfully provided. The shuffleboard was a lot of fun too! The location is awesome because it's quiet and private yet only a few miles from the interstate and stores, yet you'd never know it. The host was always super responsive and so helpful. Very much look to another visit at the Garage Getaway!"

Stayed a few nights","The outside wasn't as private or secluded as it seemed in the photos, but don't let that deter you - the inside is beautiful. Everything was very comfortable. If you're wanting a place to relax (which is what we wanted), it will definitely suit your needs. The bedroom is so dark and quiet - the perfect place to sleep. We did have an issue with the internet, but thankfully it was our last day, so it wasn't a big deal. Also, we couldn't use the ceiling fans/lights in the main room due to the lights flickering, but the other overhead lights worked very well. Definitely worth the price and would recommend."

Stayed one night","First impressions matter, right? Well, I contacted Mikel to confirm the distance to Wind Creek Casino in Wetumpka, and he responded within minutes. Wind Creek Casino is only a 20-minute drive away if you're a fan of the casino. When we arrived, I discovered that the photos did not do this place justice. The garage was not only beautifully decorated, but it felt like Alabama and Tennessee had a baby, LOL. The cabin-like atmosphere throughout the garage made us feel like we were in the Smoky Mountains. The garage is well-equipped for a short or long stay, and the freshly laundered bed linens smelled amazing. The king bed in the master bedroom was extremely comfortable, and did I mention how clean everything was? My husband was skeptical about the location because he assumed the garage was too remote based on pictures in “Maps” but the garage was situated in a secluded, yet convenient drive to the interstate. We really enjoyed our stay, and we plan to return soon !"

Stayed about a week","Mikel is an excellent host with a well-appointed and beautifully decorated place. This apartment is conveniently located to the interstate, restaurants, and shopping.
We had an issue with the beds. The king-sized bed was as hard as a rock and caused back and hip pain among our family members. The Murphy Bed mattress sunk in the middle and was not at all comfortable.
Perhaps the most concerning thing was the automotive smell that permeated the entire apartment. If you have breathing issues such as asthma, you might want to think twice before staying here. One of our family members had trouble breathing while in the apartment.
Everything we had with us at this apartment had to be washed, because it had this ""oily"" automotive smell to it.
If you're not sensitive to any of the above, I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this peaceful retreat."

Everything is there to make you feel at home, and being so far away from traffic and noise is wonderful, but you’re still so close to restaurants and shopping! This is the perfect place for us to relax after visiting family in the area. Also, Mikel is so gracious and responds very quickly. We had trouble finding the driveway since we used google maps instead of the handy instructions. He immediately messaged us back and guided us to the location, and it was late in the evening.

We slept in the quiet back bedroom but I doubt if the front was at all noisy, because it is a peaceful and leafy green neighborhood that was nonetheless close to civilization. An ideal place to stay in Montgomery"

Stayed with kids","My family and I had a wonderful two-night stay! Vicky and Josh were exceptional hosts, providing superb communication and clueing us in on all the surrounding area has to offer.
The cottage has so many YES elements!! For example, my 5 year old was able to utilize the sunroom as a perfect floor drop to play with her American Dolls and accessories. Couches and beds were super comfy to all (over 6 ft hubby included)! All the natural sunlight coming through the windows is good medicine… The whole place gives off a “come on in and be nurtured vibe.” A perfect spot to tuck away and write a book or take an extended rest from the rat race. 🙌🏻
Temperatures were below freezing during our visit and heater works magnificently, toasts the place up fast! I love a good shower and my just-over-five-foot self lingered and still had hot water upon exiting.
Both physically and psychologically warm and inviting, I’m so glad to find this 1920’s jewel! Will definitely book again."

Stayed a few nights","Pros: Property was beautiful, and there were many perks to choosing this location. Kitchen is fully hooked up with appliances, utensils, even zip lock bags and wine glasses. The washer and dryer was up to date and clean. Detachable shower heads and sink heads throughout home. The one day we had relaxing time we really enjoyed the front porch as a family. Loved the swing and the neighbors who walked during the day seemed generally friendly too. Somewhat diverse neighborhood, so we felt very comfortable during our stay.
Con: There is only one TV, and it’s in the living room. In our case we had family staying in second bedroom so it would have been nice to have a personal TV for when it’s time to wind down in your own space, but of course that is definitely not a deal breaker especially when everything else was absolutely impeccable. If we stay again I will just remember to bring my laptop or something to use instead.
Overall I very much recommend this location A+!"

Stayed a few nights","My best advice as you are reading reviews and trying to make a decision about where to stay in Montgomery- is to BOOK this fabulous cottage in Cloverdale- without hesitation! Viktoria and Josh have done an amazing job in making this historic - restored cottage the perfect place to enjoy for a few days or an extended stay.
It is decorated beautifully and it is a calming and serene space. Every glance is a photo. The bathrooms are lovely and the toiletries are divine.
The kitchen has everything you need to have a cup of coffee in the morning or prepare a meal at home. But, located just a quick couple of minutes away- are some absolutely great restaurants! Exceptional!!
My bed was so comfortable that I didn't want to leave it. But, my favorite place was the swing on the front porch!
Very attentive and response hosts and greatly appreciated them!
I am a super host in California and in Cabo, Mexico and so you can imagine that when I am looking for a place- I know what to look for in a listing. This choice was so perfect for me in everything it offered and its location in Cloverdale where I grew up and close vicinity to my family. It will be my home away from home to come home to when I return to Montgomery for future visits. 5 stars!!"

Stayed with kids","We stayed here for over a month while in the area for work and really enjoyed it. The listing photos are completely accurate - the house is well decorated but still comfortable and livable. The essentials and more are already in the house, like soap/shampoo, laundry detergent, and trash bags. We were impressed by the well stocked kitchen with everything there that we could need - plenty of dishes, mixing bowls, measuring cups, sheet pan, glass casserole, pots and pans, etc. We also appreciated the Brita pitcher with extra filters since the home is older that made us more comfortable drinking the water. We found the bed comfortable and the sheets were cotton. Both the A/C and the heat work well. All appliances (laundry, stove, fridge, etc) are older and not fancy but they get the job done. The front porch with swing was lovely and used often. We enjoyed meeting many friendly neighbors there and walking in the quiet and safe neighborhood. The owners responded to an issue during our stay in a timely manner and got someone out to fix it. We felt the pricing for the stay was good. Overall we had a good stay and we would recommend it to others!"

Stayed a few nights","Place was extremely dirty, hair in shower, dirty shower door, dirty floors, stained placemats. No extra covers, no paper towels, no bowls. Josh did send a cleaning person to clean the shower, but the whole unit needed deep cleaning and the interruption was frustrating."

We were in town for a golf tournament at Wynlakes Country Club which was about a 10 minute drive. The house was pretty clean but some of the furnishings and surfaces are definitely showing wear and tear. Overall, I’d say it was a good stay and with a few improvements it could be excellent for the next guests."

My family's biggest concern was the cameras everywhere and the lack of new and used linens and towels. The cameras make it hard to feel at home there. Having to use old towels behind strangers is just not cool. And, these things don't bother everyone, so don't let it stop you from enjoying this great home with such a friendly host!"

All local attractions are easily accessible within a few minutes’ drive and there are restaurants within easy walking distance. I definitely recommend Suzy’s place to a solo traveler (like me) or a couple!"

Gated parking is always a plus, although we didn't find the neighborhood worrisome. Also, probably the longest 2-sink bathroom counter we've ever seen in an Airbnb!

Stayed with kids","We had a wonderful stay at Jonathan’s place! Everything was as described upon arrival and it felt very cozy. I didn’t have many questions, as everything was pretty self explanatory but I somehow missed the labeled dishwasher switch- however my question was answered quickly when I did have a question that arose. Jonathan was a wonderful host, and everything that we needed was available within the home! Would recommend and stay again!"

Stayed one night","Our weekend getaway at Jonathan & Suraiya's home was absolutely wonderful! Their place is not only cute and cozy but also incredibly comfortable, making it the perfect retreat. The attention to detail in the decor and amenities was impressive, and we felt right at home from the moment we arrived.
The location was ideal, offering a peaceful setting while still being close to everything we wanted to explore. The hosts were fantastic, providing clear communication and ensuring that our stay was nothing short of perfect.
We can't recommend this Airbnb enough and can't wait to return for another visit. Thank you for a truly memorable experience!"

Stayed a few nights","This was a golf trip for four middle-aged days from PA/NY playing the Robert Trent Jones golf trail. The location is very convenient. Our rounds were at Capitol Hill (20 minute drive), Grand National (50), and Ross Bridge (80). There is a Publix and Starbucks 3-4 minutes away.
The cottage was cozy. Easily and comfortably slept 4, but thought leaving the fourth BR without a bed was perplexing.
The house is renovated and the pictures are accurate. I should add that this was a tremendous bargain and value. Would definitely stay here again since we plan on returning to play RTJ again next winter/spring.
The host is very responsive. Not overbearing. We don’t have any issues or concerns so we didn’t need to contact the host during our stay."

The hosts quickly responded to questions. After a long day of visiting The Legacy Sites and other historical places, it was nice to return here and relax with dinner, a movie, some wine, and cozy conversations. We enjoyed our time here and would definitely choose to stay here if we return to Montgomery."

Stayed with a pet","We couldn't believe how squeaky clean Jonathan's home was. The kitchen and bathrooms were spotless, the furniture is very modern and I wish we could have stayed longer than 3 days. It was located just minutes off the interstate very close to restaurants, shopping and 20 minutes to the casino.
***I have to reiterate the cleaning once again because he has TOP RATED CLEANERS. YOU won't be disappointed. It even smells clean when you walk in plus he has the guests leave the AC on at 74 degrees prior to leaving which means you will never walk into a hot and humid home.
We loved our stay and can't wait to visit again soon.
Thank you again Jonathan & Suraiya."

Stayed a few nights","Decent place, not so clean …
My wife and I had a contract in the area, so we decided to try AirBnB. We saw that it was a decent place and had multiple rooms. The pictures are pretty accurate!
We wanted something very clean, so we leaned on the reviews that emphasized cleanliness.
That was a mistake.
When we arrived, we noticed a maple syrup smell. The microwave smelled like bacon, so we knew they had breakfast that morning. (If we paid for a cleaning fee, I would assume this would include smells from 5 hours ago since checkout is 11AM & check-in is 4PM.)
Some of the surfaces were dirty/dusty. My wife normally wipes down areas and she noticed her wipes were quite brown.
The bathroom walls had accumulated vapors from the toilets. Imagine yellow water droplets on a wall above the toilet.
The bedsheets had hair in them. A lot of hair.
After 2 hours, their sweet parents apologized and brought new sheets. I give it 2.5 out of 5 stars. I wish our experience was like the other comments"

The street is quiet, place is clean and well kept. If you are traveling with a few people there isn’t much seating room but worked great for my spouse and I.
Host is super responsive would definitely stay again. Thank you so much for the hospitality"

Stayed with kids",Johnathon was easy to communicate with. He answered my phone calls everytime I called and was very helpful with us finding stuff to do locally. The home was clean and quiet and the beds were comfortable. The shower water gets nice and hot and the extra complimentary items (shampoo/body wash/conditioner/waters/few snacks) were so nice and beneficial to our last minute packing. If we are ever needing a place to stay in the area again we will most definitely book with them again. Thanks for being a great host!

The space is decorated well, clean and cozy. The outdoor spaces are private and peaceful, definitely a bonus to an already great house. A relaxing getaway spot amidst the city. Minutes from downtown and other areas. I would definitely recommend the space and the host."

Stayed with kids","I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FABULOUS, STRAIGHT OUT OF A MAGAZINE HOME.
It’s walking distance to food, shops, outlets, gas, etc. My family of 4 felt like we were at a private beach house. Everyone had their own private room and bathroom which is a bonus in itself. There is a 5th bathroom downstairs that makes you feel like you’re in a spa. The kitchen gas stove and the appliances were easy to use, she left out instructions for them, very helpful. The beds and furniture are soft and comfortable. The bathrooms are breath taking gorgeous. Her pictures nails it but the experience is beyond words.
The atmosphere gave off a sense of elated heavenly bliss. I felt a sensation of enraptured peace and relaxation in the air making us feel right at home. If we ever come back to AL, this will be the first place we look to stay.
Mrs. Shannon accommodate us as needed, just a message/call away.
Thank you Mrs.Shannon for your superb spectacular hospitality in your amazing home!

The home is beautifully furnished with a living room seating arrangement that’s perfect for conversations between couples. Although the weather was cold during our visit, the pool and garden area looked very inviting. Plus, there’s a convenient half bath near the pool so swimmers would not have to go inside the house.
The home is close to I-85 and access is easy. Lots of restaurants and shopping nearby too.
I would highly recommend Shannon’s Great Escape!"

Once you open the door, you immediately feel welcome. The A/C was already blowing cold when we arrived, perfect for a hot summer day! Bed was laid out with clean towels on top. There was also a welcome book with fabulous recommendations for restaurants and things to do in the area. I only wish we were in town for more than a day! I had no idea Montgomery had so much to offer! Better than a tour guide!
The kitchen was clean and had all the necessities for eating in. The shower has a good pressure and is easy to use. There are also shower products available to use, which was nice because we forgot to bring soap! There’s also a small dining table to eat at. So much packed into this tiny home, but not cluttered at all! Very efficient. Also the bed and pillows were super comfy.

Thomas' yellow house is perfect for the wandering solo traveler or local tourist exploring Montgomery's rich civil rights history. Neighborhood was quiet and just far enough away from downtown while great in terms of accessibility to get in and out via simple self check in even during late hours
Much better than a motel for the value and a short hop/skip from downtown. Easy access (5-10 min) to the Legacy Museum, Dexter St Churches, Civil Rights memorials, or Alabama History archives. (~45min East/West to Tuskegee/Selma areas respectively)
Thomas has a perfect welcome booklet with local venue and community recommendations. Felt safe, snug, and welcomed for my couple days stay. Likely to return in the future. Thanks Thomas!"

There are plenty of grocery/retail options close by too. The house was very comfortable, quiet and peaceful. Our daughter wanted home-cooked meals prior to returning to the base for her curfew. She truely enjoyed having a relaxing place to spend some time after having spent eight weeks in military training. We were able to spend time hanging out and catching up with each other by the water. I enjoyed my morning coffee on the screened porch. The beds and linens are very comfortable. I just wish we had more time to spend there!"

Taylor was very professional and happy to rent her property at the last minute. Thank you so much for helping me and my family. House is on a beautiful piece of property by the water, extremely clean, spacious. House looks exactly like the pictures, just gorgeous. Thank you again Taylor for being so understanding. I will be definitely renting this place in the near future."

The area was experiencing a frigid cold spell while we visited so we really enjoyed the gas fireplace! We used the Traeger pellet grill twice and our suppers had a wonderful smoky flavor! The kitchen was well stocked. We used the crockpot, made pans of brownies in the baking pans, and roasted veggies on the baking sheet. Kitchen has good knives, measuring cups, cutting boards and anything else you may need. Since we stayed a week, we also used the washer and dryer in the big laundry room. The master bed is extremely comfortable and the master shower is wonderfully big with great water pressure. The house is very conveniently located to downtown and to Maxwell AFB. I would recommend Taylor's place!"

Group trip","This is the first time that we have rented a home over Christmas and this home didn't disappoint. From the minute we walked in, we felt right at home. Prior to our arrival I had contacted Taylor to ask if she had a couple of kitchen items that we would need for food prep while there. Taylor went out of her way to purchase those items and have them available so that we wouldn't have to bring them with us. She definitely went above and beyond. Cooking Christmas Eve and Day dinners away from home for a family of 6 can be a daunting task. But ours was made a whole lot easier by everything available to us in the kitchen.
The home was warm and inviting with a beautiful fireplace for our stockings. Taylor had even decorated it for Christmas. The home has stunning views off the back screened in porch. We would have loved to have spent time down by the water but weather prohibited it. Maybe next time!
We will definitely rent Taylor's home again for any extended stay in the area!"

The thoughtful touches and amenities provided by the host truly made us feel welcome and taken care of. Like the Christmas decorations she put out, which made my family Christmas at her home feel even more special. The pictures do not give justice to how cute this home is decorated and how peaceful the view is in real time. Home smells amazing and is clean. The kitchen had everything and more to cook meals. Let’s not forget the elevator is great to have to bring up and down your luggage. I cannot think of one negative thing about the stay. We can’t wait to come back 😊"

But if your fine with deer heads then this minor detail will not bother you. Taylor was very attentive and informative.

Stayed with kids","My family and I were on a road-trip and required a last minute stay in Alabama store heading to Arkansas. We found Taylor’s house and she accommodated us on a very last minute basis. Taylor’s house was everything we could have asked for…peaceful surroundings, well decorated, clean, large yard for my daughter’s service dog, friendly neighbors and a convenient elevator to make transporting our luggage into the house a breeze…not to mention the beautifully equipped master bathroom! We arrived late at night so I will mention that coming down the dark road and seeing all the RVs made us think we were in the wrong place, but as we proceeded to the private road we were met with beautiful waterfront homes that felt private and secluded from the rest of the area. I share this information only because I don’t want others to think they’re in the wrong place. I’m quite picky when I rent places so I can assure you Taylor’s home will NOT disappoint! Thank you Taylor for taking such good care of us!"

Group trip","We had a fantastic experience at Taylor's home. Our goal was a quiet, peaceful home to relax within a short drive to the RTJ Golf Courses; Taylor's home met all of our expectations.
The home is approximately 10-12 min drive from Capital Hill and several restaurants in Prattville. It sits just a short drive off the main highway in a peaceful setting with a few very nice homes nearby. The property is very clean with a well-manicured lawn and grounds, and a beautiful private ""beach-like"" area next to the lake in back where you can relax by the fire, play corn hole, or cast a line.
Inside, the decor reminds me of a mountain lodge in the Smoky Mountains with modern amenities, there large rooms, comfortable beds, and an awesome Master BR/Bath.
Taylor as very helpful; quickly answering all of our questions and offering recommendations for dining or entertainment. She was friendly and accommodating throughout our stay and during checkout. I would absolutely recommend her Millbrook home!"

Loved the outdoor area as well! I gave everything 5 stars because Taylor did a great job and everything is very nice. Only one thing to note so others are aware! Across the street- the neighbors- had a very well lit up giant confederate flag in their window. While this isn’t an issue for some people, I was a little uncomfortable. This is in no way Taylor’s fault, but it’s something to note for others who may feel uneasy by it! Other than that, Taylor’s place itself was amazing!"

Stayed with a pet","Our family (5 adults & 1 child and a dog) so enjoyed our time at Taylor's home! Our family is in Prattville and the wedding we came to Alabama for was in Eclectic, so this was a perfect location! The home is warm and friendly and Taylor was readily available for any questions. We loved it so much, we were looking at availability for Christmas and were ready to book on the spot, but alas...it was already taken!"

Stayed with kids","I cannot say enough good things about Taylor’s place. Absolutely beautiful home in a beautiful location. Conveniently located to downtown Montgomery and Maxwell AFB, but in a very quiet and private neighborhood. The house is well stocked with supplies which made our extended stay there easy and comfortable. We loved our time here and hope to be back."

Stayed with kids",Beautiful house in great location. So close to Montgomery and all it’s sites. The outdoor can’t be beat. Enclosed porch in the house and an amazing outdoor spot along the water with a firepit and chairs. So relaxing to have a glass of wine outside with family. House fully stocked with all needed amenities. Would definitely stay here again and recommend highly.

Stayed a few nights",This place was the perfect home for a getaway! There was minor problems but Taylor was fast to fix and help with anything we had questions on! The house is so clean. Far enough from everything to have some peace and quiet but close enough to get to a local grocery store and food places. The fishing in the pond was great. We will definitely be coming back.

Stayed with kids","I honestly can not say enough about this place. It was a week and a half of pure relaxation. The house is beautiful and has everything you could possibly need. The beds are comfortable and the master bath is amazing! The screened in porch was our favorite place to hang out. The beach area by the pond was the most beautiful scenery ever. Taylor is the best host. She was always available to answer any questions. Very respectful to her guests and just all around amazing. I don’t have one negative thing to say about this place other than, I hated leaving. We can’t wait to come back and visit in the fall."

Stayed with a pet",This home was perfect! It had everything we needed to cook or grill and is 10 minutes from everything. Quiet tucked away area with plenty of space. The beach area and firepit were great and all the porches were perfect for watching fireflies and listening to the frogs.

Stayed with a pet","This property is an awesome get away experience!
You have the feels of a countryside. Very clean and spacious. If you need any to grab groceries there’s a Publix super nearby.
It’s far enough to unwind but close enough to stores if you need to grab anything.
Taylor was very responsive, definitely recommend."

Stayed with a pet","This home exceeds all expectations! Inside, it’s beautiful and equipped with everything you could possibly need. Outside, it’s a beautiful oasis! All the little touches - remote operated string lights outside and at the beach area, the record player with some nostalgic favorites, the double shower heads in an already giant walk-in shower….
My personal favorite is the screened in porch. Whether it was drinking coffee and watching the sun rise or sitting out with a cold beer while hubby grilled….the only negative is that we couldn’t stay forever!!"

Stayed with kids","I cannot imagine a nicer place to stay in the Montgomery area. Minutes away from everything yet is a private oasis on the lazy river. Quiet, beautiful and relaxing. The home has everything and more. Ideal place to spend a week off the grid with a 4 year old who could not get enough of the beach. Screened porch overlooking the large back space and the water is a classic. Keep your eyes open for the heron.
This home is memorable. I will be back."
