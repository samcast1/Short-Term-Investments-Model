Full of very nice touches to make us feel good there!
Ability to use outdoor furniture, which is greatly appreciated for having breakfast outside, or when you magnify the American dinner time!:-)"

This is in fact an efficiency apartment, very private but opening into a large beautiful fenced yard shared with our hosts. Tina is a great host.

Stayed a few nights","Everything about this ‘One Room Wonder’ was absolutely charming, comfortable, and private! The space is very creatively crafted and includes everything you could need plus extras in case a anything had been forgotten -so very thoughtful! Everything was squeaky clean and inviting. The bed was dreamy, sofa super comfy, and the round table in front of the large window just begs for you to have a seat, enjoy the view/conversation, and enjoy a snack or meal with plenty of room, never feeling crowded. The private entrance was such a charming space with super easy access. I wish I had an entrance like it at home! Our entrance was within the fully fenced backyard giving us a sense of both privacy and safety. It was a complete joy to stay here as we visited with family and friends and enjoyed our nephew’s wedding. This is a great place to stay-you will not be disappointed!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Tina was the absolute best. The place was so warm and inviting. It felt like a caring relative had fixed up a guest sweet for us. While staying there, we drove down to LUMCOM (a nature research area), which was about 45 mins away and got to see the gulf from their observation deck. On the way stop by the sculpture garden and the grocery store (very neat items). That was AWESOME if you are looking for authentic experience off the typical tourist destinations. Wish we would have spent one less day in New Orleans and one more day with Tina. I recommend that to anyone who is looking for relaxation and a kind host."

Tina and Vern are gracious and kind hosts and were quick to respond to any questions and minor issues I had. Was a bit of a challenge to get live TV on the smart tv but many apps to get streaming channels. Wi-Fi was a bit weak but I have my own so this wasn’t a problem for me.
Overall this place is excellent for the area where accommodation is very limited due to last year hurricane. I would be happy to stay again next time I’m in Houma."

The room was spacious, quite chic and included a refrigerator, microwave and a Keurig coffee maker. Although it was located neighborhood in town , it was very quiet. Numerous restaurants and stores were within walking distance. When we had questions, Tina responded quickly. We did not experience any problems. Her online guidebook offered helpful suggestions which we used as we planned each day . Pictures of this room and descriptions were spot on. Tina's hospitality went above and beyond to be sure were had everything we needed to enjoy o r stay here! My husband and I would highly recommend staying here and we would most definitely stay here when in the area."

There was coffee and a pot there as well as a microwave, stove and oven. No dishwasher so if you’re not accustomed to hand washing dishes you will not like this place.

The house was spotless clean, it’s updated yet cozy. There were plenty of towels and linens. It was great to have a coffee maker to start the day and pans/basic kitchen items as we cooked one night for dinner. There were a couple colder nights and the heater worked well. The outside patio area looks brand new, is clean and has comfortable patio furniture perfect to gather at. Each of the rooms had a TV which was a hit for our teenagers. The host was nice and responsive the entire time, even checking in to see if we needed more towels mid week. Overall this was one of the better air b n bs we have stayed at (and we’ve been in other countries). We were very far away from home, but it felt like home the week we were there. Great experience!"

The eateries were only about 10 mins away or we ordered delivery. I would definitely stay again and recommend this place for a cool, clean getaway.
Also the view from upstairs is really nice surrounded by crepe myrtle trees. My favorite 🤩"

My sister used to live in the town, and I've attended conventions there, as well, when I lived in Louisiana. Houma is a quaint place, worth visiting if you've never been.
Stephanie was very hospitable and has created a lovely getaway for her guests!"

Everything was tidy with every amenity you can think of, even contact lens cleaner. There are plenty of dishes, utensils, pots & pans to cook a full meal. Plus, she keeps on hand spices, snacks, coffee, breakfast items and more. There is even a sippy cup if you forgot your wee one's in the car. We were so comfortable and taken care of. Stephanie's place is perfect for couples, solo women, little families or anyone who wants to feel at home.

Stayed with kids","BEST little secret in Houma, La. Our visit to Houma turned out to be surprisings PERFECT! Stephanie's quaint apartment and gracious southern hospitality were more than my 17yo and I expected. Easy access to all we needed and wanted to do and enough space for us to enjoy one another without feeling cramped in a confined space. And Stephanie stocked the pantry with simple breakfast items and treats to get us through if needed. Best of all, my son and I had a BLAST right there in Houma with Stephanie's suggestion help. We went to The Ball Park and had a mom and son competition at the batting cages and mini golf (great course). We went to the AMC movies, had late night donuts at Mr. Ronnie's (hands down the BEST donut shop EVER) and yes way better than Mr. Rob's. We had massages by Michael Hattler that was great, a spa day at 4 Seasons Spa and a plantation tour at Southdown Plantation. Also highly recommend visiting the African American Museum Finding Your Roots for a balanced accurate experience. And everything was located 6 minutes from the house. BEST of the best was the food experience. Wow Wow Wow. Zen, Big Al's, Mr. Ronnie's were delicious. So much food but worth the waistline disaster. Culture, food, Relaxation and great customer service everywhere we went. New Orleans and Cafe Du Monde is an hour away and so worth the drive. While enjoying our beignets we toured the Art Sculpture Gardens and the whimsical Story Book Park. All great. Definitely would book again if I ever had a reason to visit Houma."

The original one we booked was a 1 bedroom and she reached out to us and offered us the 2 bedroom next door. Very large deck we would sit on at night and watch the barges go by. Very quiet and peaceful area. Guy across the canal was jamming to some music that was perfect for being on the canal. Not my taste of music, yet satisfying at the same time. My brother rented the first house we looked at. But we were happy for our decision change due to the neighborhood and the mosquitoes. Will definitely rent again 100%."

Was super easy to get in touch with the hosts through phone calls and subsequent texts, especially for a last minute booking. Was reassured that my mother and grandmother would be comfortable during their stay. Chose this Airbnb because it was a good fit for those with physical limitations (one level, specialized bed, parking right by the door, accessible bathing options). Grandma is almost 95, so I hoped to find something to accommodate her and was not disappointed. They stayed for a week while her house was being worked on. Thanks for the great stay!"

Stayed with a pet","Don’t be deceived when you turn into the neighborhood; it appears to be an older part of town, but the photos on the site accurately represent the studio. First and foremost it was clean and we were able to park off the street in the carport. The host(s) were tremendous and I’ll just say they catered to our requests. The kitchen utensils were plentiful and the snacks bountiful. In the bath area we were provided with numerous amenities, even a spare toothbrush if needed.
What was most important to us is this location is pet friendly. While we didn’t anticipate staying an hour from our event (Caesar Superdome in New Orleans) the value alone made it worthwhile.
Stay here, you won’t be disappointed!"

Just awesome stay on the bayou, watching the boats go by. So peaceful and relaxing and Terissa was the best! Responded immediately when I needed something and was gracious enough to give us a little later of a check out due to the bad thunderstorms. No other place I would want to stay. My friend that was with me had never stayed down there and was just so excited once he saw where we were staying and even more excited with the view and how peaceful it is.

Once back at the house I quickly realized that the frozen meals I purchased for the week could not be cooked because the oven did not work, only the stove top so I was forced to put those items in a cooler and bring them home at the end of my stay. Other than that the place was perfect for me, I was alone and it was just the right side for a single. Great place to stay overall."

I felt completely safe there, as she had yard lighting and a security system in place. Check-in was a breeze, and there were dishes and cookware, as well as a bbq grill to cook on and a cute little bar in the backyard. I really enjoyed sitting out on the back porch and watching the barges and tugs go by. We had hoped to be able to fish that evening, but her dock was under construction, so that wasn't possible for us, but it will be wonderful when it's completed!
The house has beautiful wood floors, and there were some really beautiful pieces of antique furniture in the home, including an old Victrola record player that actually worked! We really got a kick out of that! All in all, it was a refreshing alternative to a boring hotel room! I would definitely recommend staying there!"

Owner said her Dad would fix beignets for us. I figured he would cook them and bring them over. Wrong. He brought everything over and cooked them on the porch so they were fresh.
Would highly recommend this place and will stay again when back in Houma."

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I stayed at Raymond's place 4 nights. We were looking for a place out of the way, less crowded, on or near the water in order to explore more of southern Louisiana. This is one of the most comfortable, homey, well appointed b&bs we've stayed in (and we've stayed in many). Since we were there in January, it was not crowded and we were able to make day trips to Grand Isle, Houma, and just ""hang out"" and fish off the back. We caught several black drum which we released. I'd recommend the Scenic Bayou Side Home to anyone who wants to see parts of southern Louisiana, get out of the city for a while, or just sit on the back porch and fish. Thank you Raymond, for a great stay!"

Stayed with kids","This is a beautiful and comfortable home to spend a few days in. We have no complaints what-so-ever about the house or property. My family was very comfortable sleeping and lounging around while on vacation. The kitchen is very well stocked with cooking equipment and spices if you choose to stay in. The bedrooms and bathrooms were equally well stocked and even had complementary single use soaps like you'd find in a hotel. The only things I'd have liked to know before renting were just how much traffic would be on the street in front of the house most of the day. You are right on the main road/highway in the area and will hear traffic from before sun up to late at night if you're in the front living areas. My wife and child said it didn't disturb their sleeping in the back bedroom or upstairs on the canal side, but you will hear traffic all day long out front. Secondly, if you're a fisherman like I am, know there will likely be water lilies covering most of the canal most of the day. They have a pretty purple flower, and seeing the plants very much fits the marshy feel of the area, but it almost prevents fishing in the canal out back. I had dreams of spending my free time casting for fish behind the property, and that was very much unrealistic. The water lilies float unattached to anything, so they move with the current and prevented casting all but perhaps 2 hours in the 3 days we were there. You can still drop bait straight down and fish under a bobber around the individual plants, or on bottom a few feet behind the back of the property, but you likely won't be able to cast and retrieve like almost all my fishing tackle required. We caught a few bluegill, Atlantic croaker, ladyfish, and even spanish mackerel on worms, shrimp, and crabs under bobbers out back, but I wasn't able to enjoy casting for a few hours here and there like I'd imagined. The crab traps were fun to use though and we were able to have a crab boil for supper our last evening thanks to them. It was very relaxing and enjoyable to sit on the back deck and watch the water. We watched several large 5-7 ft alligator gar swim by under the weeds, as well as many a shrimp and crab boat pass throughout the day. All in all I wouldn't hesitate to rent this house again or recommend it to others. The area still shows signs of the hurricane damage all over and this is one of the few very nice properties in that area."

Stayed a few nights","Really nice place... perhaps the best ""fishing camp"" we've ever stayed in (it's not really a camp... it's just a very nice, clean house on the water!) There are so many little things that are already stocked... soap, dishwasher detergent, coffee/filters, etc. Everything is very clean and in working order. The house is even decorated very nicely. Plenty of pots and pans as well as anything else you need.
Access to the bayou is really cool and fishing/crabbing right out the back yard is great (equipment is already there too!). Unfortunately, this place isn't ideal for fishing with your boat. I could not find a good public launch nearby and getting your boat back to the house would likely be a chore with the drawbridge just south. This community is still hurting from Ida and many services are not easily found for visitors. We ended up parking the boat next to the house (plenty of space) and launching out of Coco Marina in the morning to fish from there (15-20 minutes down the road). Really, that's probably for the best anyway since the trout are already further out in June.
Overall, this is a GREAT place and Raymond is more than helpful when you contact him. As long as you know the limitations of the area you're in, you will be very happy and comfortable staying here."

He swung by one night to grab something from the garage (we didn’t mind and weren’t disturbed by it), but I appreciated his almost 2 hours heads up!
The back deck is amazing! It’s right on the water and you can just toss your fishing line over. We tried our luck at crab trapping and caught 2! The next door neighbor gave us tips and tricks on how to catch blue crabs too. Great time watching the boats go by and fish jumping out of the water.
Kitchen was WELL stocked. Probably the most well stocked kitchen I’ve ever seen at an AirBnB! The bed is SUPER comfy. I almost walked into the glass shelf late at night so watch out for that ha!"

The back deck had been torn down completely!! And no notification. Check out rules are extra extensive. Strip bed linens, wash dishes, empty all trash, but still pay a 125 cleaning fee. These days rules should be included on the listed. We texted Raymond the night before check out asking if we could stay an extra hour. No response at all and the cleaning woman showed up at 9:51. Why did we need to strip all the beds and wash the dishes if she was going to be there to heard us out????

The place was super clean and very nice. Kitchen had everything we needed to cook! The bed in the master was SUPER comfy! Property was conveniently located. Close to stores, bait shops, and about 10-15min to Coco Marina (Try the fried pickles, SO GOOD!). Overall, great rental!"

Group trip","Looking to getting away from all the things that way you down and truely relax with no worries then this is the place to be. Sitting at the southern base of Louisiana with water that homes so many species of animals you can help to fall in love with this place. Frogs croaking at night, fish jumping, shrimp boats passing by and different birds flying in and out just to name a few. You might even get a chance to see the local alligator (don't worry though they won't bother you). It's so peaceful and the locals are friendly and helpful. This home sits right on a canal that while you sit on the upper deck or lower level you're right by the water. The home is just as beautiful as the pictures show. The beds are so comfortable you drift off to sleep in no time and awake refreshed ready for another day of relaxing. If you decide you want to go sightseeing or find something adventuring to do you're not far from that either (30 to Houma, 90 to New Orleans, and 120 to Baton Rouge with so many things to do inbetween and even closer if you don't want to go out too far) l. We look forward to returning in the future."

It’s situated on a beautiful stretch of the bayou, which allowed for my sons to fish and enjoy themselves for hours on end! We are definitely making this our go-to home away from home, when we are visiting south Louisiana!"

We are a large family of 6 and had plenty of room in Raymonds home. We were able to hold small get togethers where everyone was comfortable and happy being on the water fishing. If you have never been to LA I highly recommend staying here in Raymonds home, you will not be disappointed. He provides easy access to him for any contact reasons. There are quite a few good places to eat near the home As well. We personally reccommend the pizza place 4mins away! If u have any questions about our stay or need help deciding if this is the right vacationing home for you just ask!"

Stayed a few nights","This home is even more beautiful, clean, and comfortable than the pictures show. The inside is so organized and open, and the house itself sits on a quiet street. The location is lovely with trees and the lake right under the balcony. If you're like me and have never seen fish jumping out of the water you're going to love standing on the balcony watching and listening to those guys. The area is so quiet you can relax and you can get a good sleep too. We didn't use the upstairs bedrooms but both bathrooms are nice, with more than enough towels and toilet paper, as well as hand soap. The master bath is wonderful, you won't want to leave it and you might even don a swim suit and stay in there for a few hours. The master bed is so comfortable, you're going to want one like it in your home. Also, in case there are any dry spills there are brooms and a vacuum in the laundry room. The chairs and couch are comfortable too and although we didn't stay in and watch T.V. I definitely took time to lay back in the dark leather recliner. There's something about a recliner that makes you want to take a nap. Something I know my family and I think about when we stay somewhere while traveling is how clean a place is knowing someone stayed there before us. Well, at this house you couldn't tell someone had been there before you, the cleaning process is that through. So, it's beautiful, quiet, clean, and comfortable. I couldn't have asked for more in a place to stay.
The host himself is helpful and kind. If you have any questions or concerns reach out to him and I have no doubts he'll help."

Stayed with kids","I have been working in the Houma area since 2006. Never in my time in the area have I ever felt as comfortable and at home as I did at Morgan’s property. This was my first opportunity to bring my wife and son with me on a work trip and we had the absolute best time and created memories that will last a lifetime. Morgan went out of her way during the length of our stay to ensure we were enjoying ourselves. She offered up many great restaurant suggestions and just overall really made us feel right at home. Note: Make sure to eat at least once at Cajun Critters while staying here. It is within walking distance and has the best local seafood I’ve eaten in Houma. Overall, Morgan’s property was simply impeccable. However, the true shining star is the host herself.
Thank you again Morgan for all you did for us during our time at your Airbnb. We will never forget your kindness and we will be back again very soon!"

Stayed a few nights","This home was very comfortable and clean. Location was good and in a quiet neighborhood. There was an issue with the connectivity to the TV, but Morgan responded immediately and made an appt for an AT&T tech to come out. From my experiences in the past, many hosts would not respond for hours after attempting to contact them. We were so impressed and appreciated her responsiveness!
The back yard was great for our dogs. The only strange thing was that there wasn’t a door in the house that opened up directly to the backyard, so you have to exit the carport door and go through a separate utility room to get there. Just a little inconvenient for when we had to let our dogs out in middle of night because the older one has incontinence issues.
We were there four nights and highly recommend it! Cajun Critters is also our go-to for great Cajun food!!!"

Although the outside space is shared, the host is very communicative, so it still felt very private when we utilized the pool/hot tub. The host is very responsive and friendly, so we felt at home.
I was impressed how everything in there was purposed, put together in Such a cool way, and even had towels labeled “makeup” (haha! I forgot to bring makeup wipes/remover).
The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. Every time I took a walk, it seemed like I was the only my person around 😆.
Although feasible, I wouldn’t recommend adding a 4th person (although the host gives the option), as a 3rd person makes it feel a bit cramped in there.
I loved my stay. I’m hoping that I can stay there every time I am in Houma, LA."

The swamp tour nearby and plantation tours with tons of history to pour over kept our interest during our stay. Would certainly recommend for other couples!!

The arrangement is very functional, and sitting on the porch for breakfast and dinner was both energizing and relaxing.
Check in was just after a tropical storm and that might be the cause for unreliable WiFi. I know Elise will work on it.

Stayed a few nights",Elise's place is indeed cute and cozy. It had everything we needed to have a good time in Houma. Well located to go to the restaurants and bars in the evening and it was a good base to do excursions offered nearby. We really enjoyed staying here. The swimming pool is really nice and we enjoyed using it every day. Thank you Elise!!

Stayed with kids","Worst trip ever! It is very pretty, clean and well kept. That’s where the positives end. We were told multiple times to not stand on certain bricks around the pool or touch the waterfall due to safety concerns. The dogs she has would lunge at my daughter while swimming which was very worrisome. Also, they are allowed to roam in the cottage, wet feet and all. Host tried to micromanage everything. From our arrival time to when we were leaving for dinner. Host ignored my request to turn on the hot tub for 3 hours and turned off the lights for the pool early. She acted like this booking was a burden and told me multiple times that her blood pressure was high because of us. She accused me of lying about the number of people in our party because one guest’s attendance was uncertain. I Chose this for my daughter’s birthday weekend and regret not just getting a hotel."

The bed takes a bit of finagling to get into, as it’s a Murphy bed.... but well thought out and comfortable, a great sleep."

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay. My husband was looking to do something special for my birthday and this place was a perfect special memory. There’s an adorable gate that opens to a little path that welcomes you to this adorable cottage oasis. You can sit on the sofa and take in the pool view. The salt water pool did wonders for my skin and the sleep we got in the cottage refreshed and revitalized our spirits. Everything you could want. It was sparkling clean and smells wonderful. The bed was so comfortable and was so cozy. The decor is beautiful and upscale. You are steps away from the gorgeous pool. Their pups are adorable little hosts too giving you grins, licks and tail wags. To top it off the hosts are super friendly, accommodating and kind. This is the place to stay while in Houma. We will be back again and again. Thank you so much for everything!"

Stayed with kids","This was our first Airbnb EVER. I can absolutely say that this cottage was something I’ll never forget! The southern hospitality that was shown by the owners were amazing. Our first morning, Elise and her husband brought us DELICIOUS donuts from this local sweets shop up the road (which by the way, they were so good that we stopped on the way there before our 10 hour trip home) then the next morning they surprised us with a Easter basket for our little girl with two muffins and a book. She made our Easter holiday special being so far away from home. The communication was fast, the cottage was ADORABLE, comforting, extremely clean... and WAY better than staying in a 5 star hotel. I honestly had the best experience and would love to stay here again while visiting friends. Thank you for everything, Elise!"

Great layout and spacious. We have never been to Houma before and knew nothing about the area, so we were honestly a little skeptical. There are some what appears to be some run-down houses in the vicinity, but that is a lot of Houma. Hurricane Ida made her mark and some of the city is still not repaired. However, it was very walkable we felt completely safe. All of the locals were super friendly. The location was perfect as it was close everything we were looking to do and some great restaurants. The host was amazing on communication and very thoughtful in her comments when she knew the purpose of our trip. It was a great stay, very comfortable and nice home!"

This home is situated in a quiet neighborhood with nice neighbors. It is minutes away to everything from a coffee shop to a hospital. The house was very clean, well-organized, and packed with all the amenities just like our home. My family felt secure and comfortable throughout the stay. The modern interior offered excellent Wi-Fi with television options. During our vacation an unexpected visitor came to town and he resided with us for 1 night in the amazing 1 bed, 1 bath fully furnished single apartment! Listen, you have read the listing, and now you have read this review, trust me…this is the one! The combination of the host and home, makes this place unlike any other in Houma!"

All appliances were so cute and helpful. Fridge was big. Beds/pillows were firm but surprisingly comfy. Washer and dryer was so incredible to have especially for a family of 5. Big tv in every room with Roku.
I had a few requests that Liberty Properties thoughtfully granted. They were very communicative with us. They were flexible with our flight schedule and check in and out times.
I also have a little phobia of bugs and the south has, of course, cockroaches and ants etc. I did not see one bug in this house besides the mosquitos we accidentally let in from normal use. Very clean. Will be staying here again!!!!"

I greatly appreciated the provided charging adapters in the master bedroom, as I had forgotten to bring my phone charger. The whole place was super clean & comfortable. Love the open shelving in the kitchen.
The neighbors have a dog that cries/whines at night... it's not too loud (my husband never even heard it) but just a heads-up, because it did throw me a bit on the first night, I woke up discombobulated and thinking my daughter was crying in the next room.
We would absolutely stay at a Liberty Properties home again if we travel back to Houma. Such a cute place! Excellent communication with the host too."
