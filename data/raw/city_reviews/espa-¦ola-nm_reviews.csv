It was such a beautiful cabin! My host was incredibly nice and helpful.
I’d highly recommend this place to others. It would be such a cool experience for people who aren’t familiar with the area or haven’t ever even seen or stayed inside of a cabin.
I’d definitely come back."

Stayed a few nights","We had a most lovely stay at ""the cabin""..though far too short. Our first visit to New Mexico so we were out early and back late, although I wished we could have relaxed more during the day as the cabin was that cozy. Ease if check in, beautifully clean and literally has everything an out of towner could want/need.. In both the kitchen and bathroom! Loved how quiet and peaceful it was, being just a little off the highway but didn't hear it at all. The town nearby was warned as not the best.. But we found no issue with it and enjoyed the locally owned feel of family businesses and eateries! We look forward to returning some day.. these hosts are going above and beyond to make the place cozy and were present if we needed anything although we didn't. They have even added a laundry facility and offer free wash and dry.. so kind."

Stayed a few nights",Had a wonderful time at the cabin. The kitchen was super functional and the perfect size. The bathroom is cute and functional as well. Check in and check out procedures were simple and easy to follow. During this time of year the road became muddy so if you didn’t have a 4 wheel drive vehicle I could see it being difficult to get to the cabin just to let others know.

Stayed about a week","First time in New Mexico and had no idea what to expect. The Cabin was perfect for a single woman - on a large private property surrounded by other rentals and homes. It was the perfect blend of privacy and security.
The cottontails running around in the morning was a special treat!
Rachel's place was perfect if you need to change directions during your stay, but don't want to be driving for hours to reach your destinations.
The front view out of my window was glorious and the location was convenient to many of the main attractions of Northern New Mexico - Taos, Chimayo, Abiquiu, Los Alamos, Bandolier etc....
I didn't do much sightseeing in Espanola itself but the small towns in the backroads were fun to drive through. I'm sure I missed some small shops and museums but needed to concentrate on the major sights.
The Food King in Espanola was adequate but I wish I had shopped at Sprouts in Santa Fe before I drove up to the Cabin - just more familiar to me.
Loved my stay!!"

We felt right at home, cooked with the full kitchen, had hot baths, and woke up to a breathtaking sunrise. We also found the New Mexico Wildlife Center is virtually across the street, has self-guided tours, of all the local critters, and some pretty magnificent predatory birds- including the bald eagle! This place is a gem, simple but cozy glamping; we would love to come back anytime!"

We particularly liked:
• Very quiet and private location away from the tourist crowds
• many destinations worth seeing within short time (Bandelier NM, Los Alamos, Valles Caldera, Santuario de Chimayo)
• beautiful view
• good room layout
• Appealing, very high-quality and thoughtful furnishings
• harmonious decoration
• perfect cleanliness
We can recommend the accommodation 100%."

Stayed a few nights","I had a lovely stay here! The tiny home looks exactly like the photos! It was perfectly clean and I loved the cabin decor! There is a beautiful desert landscape right outside. I did see a coyote type animal walking in the desert across the cabin in the daytime, didn’t bother me but if you have a child or a pet I would keep a close eye on them. This location is only a 30 minute drive from Santa Fe. There is a really cool place called the New Mexico Wildlife Center wildlife animal rescue that is only $5 to visit and 5 minutes down the road, highly recommend! The wi fi in the cabin worked well. Everything worked great and was very cozy and clean! Feedback is I wish they provided non stick cooking spray for the dishes. They provide coffee and tea which was really great! I felt safe as a single woman staying here alone"

Stayed one night","Rachel is a very conscientious host! I stayed at the cabin on a deep cold February night, and it was a little cold even with the heater on. The hot water heater went out about 10 minutes into my shower and it turned out to be a tripped circuit breaker. When I got in touch with Rachel about it on the morning of, she quickly sent a family member to investigate it and fix it, but the hot water heater did run out again within about 10 minutes. This is a good value but $170 with no discount for the shower did feel expensive for the stay.
However I highly recommend Rachel and her family as responsive hosts and the cabin is very cute!"

Stayed a few nights","The cabin is located in a quite and safe area near the twin peaks which you can see them in the room and in front of the house. Great view! You can see so many stars during the night, cause there is limited city lights nearby.
Room is clean and tidy, also equipped with basically everything you need.
Only downside is that the AC/heat was okay, since during the evening the outside was about 20-25 F, we turned up the heat to 78F for all night, but it didn’t seem make it warm a lot. However, they do have extra blankets and bedding which helps a lot.
Other than that, everything else was great!"

I appreciate their hard work on making sure everything was fixed for me in a timely manner.
I was there staying during some cold cold weather, and the wall heat unit had a little difficult keeping up to warm the casita, but wasn’t a huge deal. Just bring layers if staying in winter months. I would absolutely stay there again!"

An outstanding breakfast can be had just down the street at La Cocina (have the piñon pancakes!). We will absolutely choose to stay here again on a future trip to northern New Mexico."

Stayed one night","This is a a very tiny and cramped casita (the bed takes up most of the room) which is OK for an overnight stay only. There is no TV and few amenities. We had told the host we would be arriving after dark. The casita is located on a fenced compound, located on a dark and unpaved road. The compound was completely dark when we arrived. The host provided minimal instructions about parking and checking in, and we had difficulty finding the casita in the dark. The casita itself had no lights near the door, and no interior light had been left on, so it was necessary to fumble around in the dark with our phone flashlights to get in. This was a little more adventure than we like when checking in to an AirBnb. It certainly didn't make us feel like the host valued our stay."

Can't say enough good things about our host Lisa too. Quick to respond, works with the customer well, friendly and goes the extra mile to ensure the stay is a positive one.
The Casita is Awesome (note the capital A).
It's a perfect fit for 2 and any potential customer could look till they're blue in the face and would be hard pressed to find a better situation. The location is ideal as it's convenient to most attractions in the township. And the iron gate, operational with the supplied clicker is a nice touch, it's comforting to know you're vehicle is safe while in an unknown town. The larger yard is private, secure and wonderful; the abundance of apple trees adjacent to the Casita are a real treat and create an atmosphere of relaxation.
All- in- all, extremely pleased. Will DEFINITELY stay again. Thank you Lisa."

The shower was beautiful and the cool breezes from the window lulled us to sleep after a big day hiking the Caldera and a great meal at La Fonda. Close to Los Alamos, Jemez, Bandelier and Puye Cliffs for big adventuring. Great for couples. Friends should be very comfortable with one another-tight quarters and though there is a door, its a slider and leaves some space and gaps-so not a ton of privacy between bathroom and bedroom."

The Barn is removed from the busy roads of Espanola which made for quite nights and we enjoyed going outside to hear chickens, roosters, and turkeys in the morning (couldn't hear them inside 😉)
We had some confusion with making our reservation and a maintenance issue during our stay, hosts were responsive and understanding.

Stayed a few nights","This place was absolutely amazing. I Travel constantly and prefer to stay at Airbnb's because they're much more peaceful than a hotel, and you get to help out individual families, Americans working to fulfill their dream. I'm a big dude, and the majority of the time, these tiny homes can get a little cramped, but they usually suffice. This was probably my favorite ""tiny home"" I've ever stayed at. PERFECT SIZE. Small enough to be cozy but enough room for me to literally use my VR headset that I utilize for work. The area was so beautiful it was like a bath for my soul. Speaking of baths, I'm 6ft2 290, and the bathtub was big enough for me to fit comfortably. if I could give 6 stars I would. Saving this place under my favorite!"

Stayed a few nights","The Barn was a very comfortable small space to stay for my 4 night weekend with beautiful scenery. It was very quiet and peaceful. It is located off of the beaten path but close to Santa Fe, Los Alamos and surrounding area. The cost was very reasonable, very affordable cleaning fee and check out was just a few easy steps before I left. I hope when I visit the area again The Barn will be available. Thank you Rachel and Eileen for an easy check in process and a wonderful place to stay as I visited Santa Fe and the surrounding area."

Stayed with kids","Run, don't walk, to The Barn! If I could give it 6 stars, I would. Lovely house, gorgeous setting, convenient to both Santa Fe and Taos. It was a little hidden off the main road but hosts' directions (including photos) for finding The Barn were excellent. As my daughter said, this ""tiny house"" was like a Tardis -- bigger on the inside than on the outside. It felt quite spacious, with a full kitchen and airy bedroom/sleeping area, and my 14 year old loved the loft sleeping area. Lovely decor and thoughtful touches throughout. We also took all the hosts' recommendations for restaurants and they were great. Very quiet and so dark at night -- you see the Milky Way easily. Basically, if I could have a second (tiny!) home somewhere, I would want it to be like this one. Thanks so much, Eileen and Rachel!"

Stayed one night","My wife and I have stayed at the Barn twice now in less than a year and feel ""at home"" each time we stay in to cook dinner and take it easy. Rachel and Eileen have made it easy to show up, get in, and kick back with what we need to cook dinner, breakfast, and feel rested the next day...The quiet, semi-rural setting of the Barn feels peaceful and relaxed. The cool part is that staying at the Barn leaves us close to lots of great locations to drive (Santuario de Chimayo), visit, hike (Nambe Falls), and eat (Rancho Chimayo)...all within 20-40 minutes...We'll be back..."

Additionally, the laundry room was a splendid surprise after a long journey. It also provided a dose of humor with its collection of hilarious comic strips, making a mundane task into a very unique activity.
The Barn is nestled in a beautiful farm setting and my quick stay was a peaceful retreat. Thank you very much for having me!"

Stayed over a week","I stayed at the Barn for 41 days. New to the area, moving from Massachusetts, I was looking for a temporary Airbnb rental. The main reason I chose the Barn is because the hosts always provide a lightening speed response to my inquires, compared to other Airbnb hosts who respond slowly.
The Barn has a feel of coziness with everything you need, a comfortable queen size bed, bathroom, kitchen, closet to hang clothes and a very cozy upper loft with a small bed. It has the feel if you're in a small cabin.
The location is in a very peaceful environment. When I step out as I look to my left I see the mountains and to my right foothills. At night-time, you can occasionally hear the coyotes yelping which I absolutely adore.
Santa Fe is 25-30 minutes , Los Alamos 30 minutes and Taos 1 hour. There are several places to eat close by in Espanola, my favorite is La Cocina (Mexican restaurant), 8-10 minutes away. I enjoyed my stay and would definitely go back!! Kudos to the Hosts, Grias!!"

When staying in Airbnbs, we love to cook - and the kitchen had everything we needed, from new appliances to all of the cooking basics so we didn't need to bring or buy the essentials -- this was SO appreciated.
Cute loft, lots of Southwestern charm...a great place to recharge. The host Rachel was super easy to communicate with, though we had no problems or troubles at all to sort out. Would definitely recommend!"

It gets really hot during the day and we happened to be working nights, sleeping during the day and visited during the hottest of seasons. If you plan on being away from the home during the day there won’t be an issue as it is very comfortable in the evening/mornings. I’ve found that many homes in this region do not have air conditioning so it’s par for the course. Again, beautiful home with plenty of space and privacy!"

Stayed with kids","We can not say enough good things about our time at Kata’s lovely properties. We stayed in two, Casita A and the Road Runner. Adorable shabby chic places with local artistic flair!
Catherine helped us find a local mechanic when our car needed the battery replaced. She took us on a tour of the local church and shared so much knowledge about the area.
The house was an amazing spot for the five us to “home base” to do so many things in the area. Literally the kids favorite Spring Break!
One time my 10 year-old locked the door of the restroom and Catherine (aka Kata) had someone over to change the door handle in minutes. Amazingly responsive. Thanks!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a great spot to homebase your Sante Fe, Taos, Angel Fire explorations.
The hot tub is fantastic, easy to use, and private.
The courtyard is functional and peaceful.
Kitchen has everything needed for meals.
Host was very responsive to any issues and knowledgeable about the area.
The only issues I'd feel worthy of comment are minor and easily corrected:
- the beds are rock hard. My wife actually asked if we were laying on the box springs
- the lockbox was not present on check-in (it broke) so although I choose places with self check-in so I don't have to interact with hosts, I still had to for both check in and check out.
- recommend a cookie sheet for the kitchen for oven things. The pans worked, but awkward for pizza and TV dinners.
- while the heaters in the house are probably adequate for normal area temps, we got inches of snow that weekend and the main heater struggled to heat the main areas of the house. However the blankets in the wardrobe are great"

Stayed with kids","Evolve has nothing to do with the host herself. Place is beautiful and easy to find, just not equipped properly for the cold I had my mother and younger brother with me and the place only had one small electric heater that really didn't keep the place warm. When I spoke to the host about this the next morning she did try to make adjustments but it was much too cold for my mother. I tried to remain respectful and tell her my mother just can't stay in a cold building for long. I told her I would not be staying for the rest of my scheduled stay and asked if I could get my money refunded for the remainder days scheduled and she stated ""Once I see a five star review I will refund you the money"". Do as you please with this information. The place is great for a short summer trip but not made for the cold weather here."

Stayed with kids","We loved this place and it suited us well for our quick trip. The bedrooms were cozy and the sleeper sofa in the living room (though we didn’t use it for sleeping!) was cozy and nice for a morning spent reading. Also: the patio was a wonderful perk! Our only disappointment (and maybe this is an Airbnb-wide thing) was that we were expected to do some cleaning - taking out the trash, stripping the beds - and then charged a cleaning fee. Of course, we cleaned up after ourselves like proper adults, but we weren’t fans doing a potion of house-cleaning and then paying someone else to do the house-cleaning. Still, this is a great place!"

While we chose a further location for its affordability, the aesthetic and comfort of this stay made it very appealing on its own. Wish we could have stayed longer! The place is larger than it appears in photos and very charming. The hot tub was certainly a draw, which we enjoyed in between the festivities and sleeping in. The large patio was a nice surprise for tea and catching some sun. Kathryn, whom we only texted and talked over the phone with, was communicative and sweet."

The good news is we will definitely stay here again when we return to do more hiking and sightseeing!
The bad news - for us - is we will probably never stay in another Air BNB as amazing as Sage Casita when we travel to other places. This place is ""simply the BEST!!""
Thanks for an amazing experience! We'll be back!!"

Yes, it’s right by the highway, but inside you can’t really hear it. (There was a coyote howling the second morning, which was actually awesome.)
Kathryn graciously welcomed us at the last minute when are original accommodations had a gas leak and no hot water. We were amazed to find it available for the holiday and hope more people will check it out. It’s so central to everything.
And then there is Mayor McCheese. What a treat!"

Outdoor gas grill and fire pit. Beautiful sunsets and night sky. Close to Bandolier, Las Alamos, great scenic drives-high and low road to Taos, and Sante Fe. Wonderful stay. Near 285. Don’t hesitate to use provided ear plugs; traffic on 285 has large trucks quite a bit of the night. We loved our stay. Kathryn and her family were welcoming and friendly. Thank you.

The bed is comfortable and the linens are nice. The bathroom is beautiful and well finished and they use quality soaps. I love attention to small details and this place doesn’t disappoint.
It’s right by the highway but that area isn’t near any lights and so there’s no break noise or revving. And there are window units in both main rooms and so the white noise drowns out any car noise.
This is on a very well kept property. It’s very quiet and private and feels very safe. I’ve stayed at a lot of local short term rentals when I come for business and I think this one is the best. I’d highly recommend it."

The house was spectacularly decorated, had EVERYTHING you could even dream of needing, and we felt instantly at home and lucky to have found such a lovely home to stay in. There were so many treasured little spots to lounge in and we each had our own spaces for solo time and many places to gather for meals and outdoor hang time. The kitchen was fully stocked with cooking items and spices, coffee, etc. Misty has thought of everything you might need for your stay and it truly felt magical at the Ranchito.
The location is perfect- we enjoyed hiking/running the BLM land and the views were spectacular. We were really close to Santa Fe and other amazing day trips, but we found that we just wanted to get back to hang out at the Ranchito as much as possible.
100% coming back to the Ranchito and highly recommend!"

The Ranchito is thoughtfully decorated. There are lots of places to sit outside the house, each with a different view of the surrounding hills and mountains. We were also grateful to be able to walk out the back of the property directly onto park land.
Even though the kitchen is a little cramped, it came fully stocked with spices, basics, and utensils so that we were able to cook some fancy meals with a South Western flair.
And Misty was a gracious host, answering all of my questions and making sure our stay was comfortable."

She was so amazing to communicate with and was always available when we had questions. The house and the space around was so fun and it was so peaceful. We absolutely loved having the ability to not have to drive to find hikes because there were so many trails behind the house on the 12,000 acres of BLM land behind the house. The multiple outdoor sitting spaces with fire pits was great. Everyone had a space to chill on their own to snuggle into a great book but as well great spaces to share evening stories of our adventures of the day. You definitely can’t go wrong staying here."

Misty also offered wonderful suggestions for things to do, if you wanted to escape for an afternoon or a day.
This was one of the best experiences I've ever had -- here or abroad. All of us marveled every day at how much thought was taken to make the retreat beautiful and enjoyable -- and how our vacation was so perfect. Can hardly wait to return."

Group trip",Awesome relaxing ranch. Our group had a wonderful time. The house was incredible the land scape was unreal and the hiking trails in the back were an added bonus. We spent the nights by one of the many sitting areas outside by the fire. Misty was awesome with communication and gave us great recommendations around the area as well as detailed instructions on what the ranch had to offer. We can't wait to come back and relax! Pro: the beds were so extremely comfortable :)

Group trip","My friends and I stayed at Misty’s place for a girls getaway weekend, and boy did we choose the right place! I can’t say enough good things about the house itself and also the host Misty! The home is stunning, and even better than the photos. It feels as though you are on a giant beautiful movie set with the impeccable decor and natural/beautiful landscaping. Misty herself is a host that went above and beyond for us. Not only was she super friendly and responsive, she also helped us book a private in-home yoga session, gave a ton of great recommendations, and pre-prepped a beautiful lunch for us to eat upping arrival while also bringing our grocery delivery inside and having champagne waiting for us. It was a dream booking :)"

Stayed with kids","Definitely one of the best Airbnb's I've stayed at. It's an amazing house with lots of charm in a great location that feels super private and peaceful but it still relatively close to everything. Having BLM land and hiking trails right off the property was a huge perk. Nice kitchen, good for cooking, and lots of indoor and outdoor spaces to enjoy. The cowboy pool was also super relaxing at the end of the day.
Misty herself was super responsive and helpful, and gave a lot of good local recommendations. The one time we needed something (ran out of propane), she was able to address it super quickly (around 10 minutes).
Overall we loved our time here and would definitely stay again."

It's an amazing sanctuary, beautifully decorated, and perfectly located and private that helps you relax, leave your worries and stresses behind, and was exactly what we needed for a get away. The house is well decorated and stocked (in all amenities, kitchen equipment, veggies and herbs, etc.). Misty was so helpful and extremely responsive with recommendations of local activities, hikes, restaurants, and the like for when we were ready to venture off the property, as well as suggestions for stops along our drive to and from the airport. Would absolutely love to go back!"

The house was well equipped with everything we needed and appreciated the extra thoughtful touches. We had lots of rainy days so the fire place created for cozy family nights in. Comfy beds and linens! The easy access to hiking behind the house was amazing! We did find ourselves competing for the one bathroom. Very relaxing house in a very quiet neighborhood; the 6 acres provided lots of privacy (confirm with host that the security cameras are turned off) with beautiful views of mountains and sunsets. Would not hesitate to stay here again!

The 5 of us felt like we had plenty of space for privacy when we wanted it and great spaces to gather together when we wanted. It was one of the best, if not the best, Airbnb I’ve stayed at!

There were so many special spots and nooks inside and out and not enough time to experience all of them. Misty's place feels like a home...very inviting, much like her personality.
One of my favorite memories of her place is sitting outside and listening to the birds, I can only imagine the aliveness at this place in the spring time. I would return in a heartbeat and stay longer. Misty, thank you for all your special touches and attentiveness and so glad we got to meet."

Stayed with a pet","To say we were blown away by Misty's home and hospitality is an understatement! First off, Misty's home was even better than the pictures, (which I didn't realize was possible!). It was so cozy, and set up perfectly for our stay-- she had everything we needed and more to make us feel right at home. The views from every angle of the home were stunning, not to mention Misty has multiple cozy seating nooks set up around her property, so we never missed a sunrise/sunset. We spent our holiday at Misty's, with my two dogs, parents, sister, husband and baby and it was set up perfectly for all of us (my dogs absolutely loved all of the open space!). The house was secluded and surrounded by amazing hiking trails, and yet we were still only an easy 20 min drive from Santa Fe. It was also really fun to explore the local towns nearby as well. Misty provided us with a STELLAR list of her favorite restaurants, shopping, etc.. All in all, it was a fantastic stay, we'll def be back!!"

I contacted Ryan on our way as I had lost the directions and he responded quickly with a copy of the step by step instructions. It was a little tricky to find as the street sign had blown down but once we knew where we were going it was easy to come and go. Also the casita was quite cold when we checked in and took a while to warm up but once it did we were quite cozy. We would certainly recommend and would definitely stay again in the future.

They did an amazing job decorating and setting everything up. We drove in with our toddler and dogs and it was nice to have the fenced in outdoor space for everyone to move around in. The only challenge was not having a door to separate the bedroom from the kitchen and living space for when our little one went to bed or took naps, but it ended up working out just fine. We'll definitely stay here again the next time we visit Santa Fe!"

The cell reception isn’t great, but Wi-Fi calling worked fine and the internet was reliable. The casita is close to a grocery store and a few restaurants and is just a 15 minute drive into downtown Santa Fe, so it gave a little reprieve from the hustle and bustle.

You're out of the congestion in Santa Fe, yet you're minutes from the Plaza. The property is at the beginning of the High Road to Taos - a wonderful day trip. If you're planning several days or more, you might want to check out the Pojoaque Pueblo Wellness Center with a full gym and a lap pool open to the community - and just a few minutes' walk from the casita. Couldn't leave more positive feedback for Johana and Ryan. I had a memorable two-month stay."

We had one night were the power went out due to a crazy storm and Ryan and Johana were amazing about making sure we were okay and did a great job communicating with us till the power was back on. Also great selection of Keurig cups! :)"

The backyard is huge and amazing for a pup to play around in. It truly feels like a vacation everyday here.
The property is safe and gated with lots of room to play. Ryan and Johana are the perfect hosts with the best local recommendations. I would highly recommend staying long term if possible. We are so grateful to be able to call this place “home” for awhile."

The host anticipated what I would need and stayed in contact with me. Having the walk in shower and laundry was a plus, as was the 3 sided garage. The twinkle lights were delightful, and I enjoyed seeing them come on each evening. It was close to the market for picking up a few extra groceries. This was a great home base for exploring Santa Fe as well as hiking around the Jemez and Truchas. I felt truly relaxed and refreshed from my stay."

Stayed a few nights","So cute!! This place was plenty big enough for my boyfriend, dog and I. The stove was plenty to keep us warm during winter, you may even want to switch it on and off during the day to keep it from getting too hot. It’s fake wood, so don’t worry about having to switch out firewood. Comfy bed, 2 types of coffee makers, and plenty of kitchen supplies to cook at home if you want. The yard is fenced if you are bringing a pet. The owners gave really good tips for things to do and places to eat in Santa Fe. The ONLY thing I can complain about here was the location. Most of the hiking spots were SW of Santa Fe so a 20-30 minute drive from the Casita, and we took our dog with us on a hike almost every day. That was the only time the location bothered us, having to take her back home after a hike and rushing back to Santa Fe for dinner or to go do another activity. Our two big activities were also SW of Santa Fe, 45 minutes from the Casita. I would just think ahead to what you want to do. If we didn’t want to hike daily, the drive wouldn’t be as bad. And if we didn’t have a dog to take back every day we wouldn’t be driving around so much.
I have to recommend this place though. It is so nice, and the price was extremely reasonable. We will stay again if we’re ever in Santa Fe again."

There was covered parking and a security gate opener provided for our stay. The smart TV, wifi, and dish network were great, and it had a beautiful kitchen complete with a good sized dining area. There were string lights over the patio that came on at night that added a stylish touch as well. I could live in this place! The area was very quiet and I loved the adobe style with exposed beams construction. I would definitely recommend this Casita!"

The property is not very hard to find for its seclusion. We loved our stay and enjoyed the area very much. I would definitely recommend and will probably return.

The location is very convenient to Santa Fe, but off the beaten path and much less expensive than staying in Santa Fe. We also visited Chimayo, Taos, Los Alamos, and Ghost Ranch--easy trips from this location; others, like Bandelier are also close by. The host left maps and brochures for us, with local recommendations for nearby small communities as well as for Santa Fe and other noted destinations. The casita was quaint and the views beautiful. Our host supplied many amenities (coffee and teas), including Wifi and streaming services. The host responded quickly to any questions. The location also felt very safe -- with a gate to the property and bolt locks on the doors. I highly recommend the Casita de Nambe!!!"

Perfect interior decorating that fits the Santa Fe atmosphere I was seeking. Perfectly clean. Kitchen utensils well thought out and I didn't need to buy anything in order to cook chorizo eggs with tortillas. The Keurig coffee maker was dead on for guests (if you want a stronger coffee than regular drip coffee methods). There was plenty of closet space to hang clothes and put your luggage in. I would rather enjoy a private casita space than getting a normal room at the Hilton or Marriott. I hope to visit here again when going to Chimayo Chapel. ❤️

Stayed with a pet","The little casita was a perfect size and a perfect reprieve for a gal and her dog while renovations were in full swing at our house. It was fun to be poolside. The sparkling clean pool outside the window beckoned me to swim a few laps each day. And the the hot tub was a luxurious warm-up in the morning and evening. The groundskeeper made sure this aquatic area was very clean and running well. There is a wonderful history of this place and I highly recommend it. Just make sure you don't let the door shut without having the code memorized or your phone with you. And be very careful of low clearance doorways!
Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful ranch, Cary!"

Stayed with a pet","The tidy, cozy casita at the Llama Ranch was the perfect place for my summer vacation with my dog. Highlights were drinking morning coffee outside and evening walks around the property—keep your eyes peeled for a variety of birds. My dog loved the doggie casita and play area. The pool was clean and cool, perfect for a refreshing swim after hiking in the Jemez Mountains or Pecos Wilderness. It’s easy to find, just off the highway to Santa Fe, and Cary is a gracious host (and picked up on the first ring when I called after locking myself out!). This is a can’t-miss stay if you appreciate the natural beauty of northern New Mexico but desire modern amenities and convenience."

Stayed a few nights","This was my second time staying at the casita. Our first stay was very enjoyable, so when we saw the casita was available during our trip, we booked immediately When we arrived, the casita needed to be swept but the rest of the casita was clean. We noticed that the pillows were very worn in but Cary took care of us and had new ones delivered. We were not informed about construction happening on the property and am disappointed that wasn’t communicated before arrival. The gate was left wide open during the day, trucks and machinery were coming and going frequently, and workers were walking and working closely by the casita windows. I understand construction can be unplanned, but I think guests should be notified and given a discount for this inconvenience. We wanted to stay at the casita to get away and spend some quality time in nature; however, we felt very uncomfortable. After this stay, I do not think I will return."

The kitchen met all my needs for breakfast, as I had the rest of my meals with my sister who lives a few miles away, but her guest space was full. I'm glad I got to come back to the Llama Ranch every night and have some peace and quiet to reflect on the day, which was pretty intense because of my sister's health issues. When I come back to Pojoaque, if I need a place to stay, this will be the first place I look."

It’s secluded but not isolated and totally fenced in- we felt so safe and relaxed and had everything we needed from hangers to to-go cups. And it was more affordable than motel 6! 10/10 would stay here again in a heartbeat

Stayed a few nights","Lovely little casita situated close enough to Santa Fe and Chimayo for an easy drive. The place is quiet and cozy enough for two people or solo. As other reviewers have mentioned, yes there is an occasionally strong sulfur smell to the water, but the owners make it very clear they’re aware and working on that, as well as stating that it’s safe. Knowing this beforehand made it a lot easier to deal with and air out. This is also the desert, and there will be the inevitable bugs, so if you’re squeamish keep this in mind — but they’re harmless. This is a lovely little spot aside from those two things, and certainly worth a getaway."

It is near the major highway road (less than two minutes), making it idea to be near the city without being in the city proper. As with other reviews, the water does have a smell of sulfur but if you open the windows it quickly dissipates and having talked to the property owner they have plans to address the issue in the near future. However, rest assured that this smell does not linger on your body or hair after you shower."

Place is simple and is a country home. No bells and whistles. Bring water! The water is smelly but not that bad. We didn’t drink the water. I would also recommend you bring pillows. Thankfully we brought some with us. The pillows are very flat.
Overall the house is quiet and safe. It is located about 20-25 minutes from downtown Santa Fe so it’s a hike to go back and forth.

Stayed a few nights","I enjoyed my stay at Cary's casita. The location was great, as it was 30 minutes from Santa Fe, Los Alamos, and a little over an hour away from Taos. The place itself was clean and the wifi worked really well. Parking was easy, too.
The only reason I'm giving four-stars is because of the smell of the water and the plumbing in the toilet. The sulfur water smell is pretty extreme so bathing and brushing my teeth were things I dreaded while there. The toilet's plumbing is very old (which is labeled in the bathroom), so I did not flush anything that old plumbing couldn't handle, but the toilet still clogged and flooded every time I flushed it.
Overall, the stay was good, and the hosts were extremely nice and accommodating. I'd suggest bringing lots of your own water for drinking and cooking, and if you're sensitive to smells, the sulfur water may not make this the best stay for you."

Stayed with a pet","We’ve stayed at this property in a different rental & loved it, so we had high expectations. This stay however left a lot to be desired. Prior to our stay we sent an inquiry that went left unanswered. While check-in starts as early as 3pm, we received no instructions (including gate & door codes) until 4:30pm. A previous guest’s sandals had been left in the backyard which leads me to believe that that area is overlooked between guests. The hot tub is not well maintained- there were broken pieces sitting in the tub as well as visible dirt on the bottom, scum on the sides & hair floating around. The temperature was turned all the way down in the low 80s, so unfortunately we couldn’t utilize it the night we arrived. Not worth the >$200 we payed for a single night. Will not be returning."

Stayed with a pet","Cute, very traditional looking casita tucked away in a quiet country side. Its not far away from Santa Fe, yet its the perfect location to enjoy quietness. Location was perfect.
While it is a cute casita, few things that others should prob know before staying here..
1. Yes water does smell. I grew up in a country side in MO, so I am no stranger to the smell- which is why I brushed off reviews mentioning water. Unless you deal with the rotten egg smelling water daily basis and you are super used to it.. Its gonna be hard to shower/brush your teeth with the water :(
After each shower, the whole casita smelled like rotten egg.
2. Casita might be smaller than what you expect. I am sure it wasn’t intentional but the actual place felt a lot smaller than the picture.
3. Casita was little dusty. Granted that this is a casita located inside of the ranch, we still found it dirty… Clumps of hair + dust mixture rolling around the floor, dusty furniture.
Although we really really wish it would have been better, this place wasn’t really for us. We didnt expect hotel grade amenities and clean-ness, but the water smell and dust really threw us off. With tax and fees, paying $220 per night.. we would rather look for other options next time :("

We had a mild inconvenience with the electricity going out and having difficulty getting ahold of Cary, however, they were very apologetic and were able to explain why they weren't able to immediately respond. We loved the space and felt that the distance from Santa Fe was very reasonable allowing for the more secluded feel with the convenience of town being close by."

Stayed one night","Wow!
Driving through New Mexico, we wanted a sort of getaway from the city and road noise and this little casita blew all our hopes and needs out of the water!
The red brick flooring, adobe walls, the comfortable bed overlooking an open valley and lots of trees, and the well prepared welcome instructions for check in/out made our stay comfortable and seamless in every way. The kitchenette had everything for a full kitchen and the coffee maker was on point. Nice bathroom and the temperature through the night in the casita stayed cool and comfortable even with no heat turned on in mid 20°F climate!
Privacy, check.
Quiet and connected with nature, check.
Accommodating and informative host, check!
10 out of 10 recommend staying here, we wished we didn’t have to leave!"

The only issue (which wasn’t much of one) was the sulfur smell that comes with the water in the shower. We just opened the window in the bathroom while showering and this solved the problem! Would 100% recommend this place :)

It was a little stinky to shower in. But overall loved this place and was an adorable ranch to stay at!"

We had some trouble after the first night when the power went out due to a huge storm (not the fault of the host!) but Cary and the staff were helpful in getting us to the warmer Casita with fireplace inside. Power returned that evening, but we were thankful for the accommodation! Overall the ranch was filled with history and culture, providing an experience to remember. Space heaters and plenty of blankets to keep you warm in the winter. Location is good if you plan on hiking at nearby parks/trails."

Stayed a few nights","This little casita in Pojoaque is a great value but as with all things in life you get what you pay for. The place itself is cute, the bed is comfortable, and it’s clean enough (though could be better). The biggest complaint we had was the sulfur content in the tap water leaving sinks and the shower smelling strongly of rotten eggs. The host provided bottled water to drink and use for brushing teeth, but that didn’t do much to help with showers that caused our skin and eyes to sting and left us feeling and smelling pretty gross. We didn’t know to expect this and probably would have opted to stay elsewhere if we’d known the problem was so bad. If the plumbing is addressed and the promised pool renovation complete, the casita has plenty of charm and is worth checking out."

Stayed over a week","Beautiful ranch! This adorable little casita is great for one or two, who are looking for a true New Mexico feel! It has warmth and character. It’s cozy and authentic. I absolutely loved the huge beautiful cottonwoods all over the property.
Check in was easy. The place was clean and smelled good. Owners are very responsive, kind and friendly.
I especially enjoyed the walking path at sunrise and sunset. Although there are no llamas anymore, there are neighboring goats, sheep and roosters that add to the experience. And the gazebo’s rocking chair was nice after a long day.
This casita is private and looks like the photos. It sits off the main road so you can hear cars in the distance but it’s tucked away enough to give you a taste of living on a ranch. It’s 5 minutes or less from stores and gas stations. Some restaurants are nearby. Santa Fe, Chimayo, Taos and other AWESOME places and views to enjoy are just a short drive. Great location!"

We were pleasantly surprised that there was also a hot tub available for our use. One thing to consider when staying here is that the house is old and therefore makes some noises; my partner was woken up early in the morning by the heater, which had started making banging noises. Overall, we had a lovely stay and will definitely be back to explore some of the other casitas on the property!"

Stayed a few nights","the casita is on a historic farm about 20 minutes from the city center of santa fe. while the farm is no longer in operation, it felt really special to be able to be able to stay in an adobe home from the 1800s! as it is “country living” and a historic home, we did get a little warm at night and the sink/shower water did have a slight sulfur smell - but we didn’t mind. abby was thoughtful enough to leave bottled water for this reason. we loved the quiet and the privacy of the casita. would definitely stay again!"

We only stayed for one night so we didnt get to use the kitchen but it was cute and had mugs, a stove, small fridge, coffee pot and some dishes. The shower water smell was strong but we enjoyed having a warm shower after a long day of travel. Overall, we loved the property!"

Stayed a few nights","This little casita does not want to let you go!
I spent 6 tranquil days in this sweet little place, and I don't think I was ever more relaxed in an AirBnB. Even better is that it's a working farm, so you really feel like you're a part of the landscape. Nina & Matt are super friendly! Kaya the farm dog is even more friendlier and has no problem trotting over and checking in on you.
The bedroom is EVERYTHING - the thick adobe walls hug you all night!!! The kitchen invites you to stay awhile, sitting at the little table sipping on coffee, and the front porch is perfect for breakfast as the sun is coming up over the cottonwoods and birch that the casita is nestled under.
Nina and Matt are really proud of their farm, and will take you for a tour and offer a taste of freshly pulled from the ground veggies if they are available. Everything in the casita functions well, but I did not use the TV so can't comment, but really - go for a bottle of wine and a couple of good books! Thank me later"

It has a rustic feeling and is cozy with a warm ambiance. We wanted for nothing. It is private and quiet location. I mentioned that this is working farm. Recommend that you take the farm tour first thing. Well worth the half hour you’ll spend and will give you a warm appreciation for the hosts, Nina and Matt and may even affect your dinner plans.
The farm and casita are located just outside the village of Nambe. From here we able to sightsee and shop from Taos to Santa Fe and points between.
For us, it was a memorable quiet getaway that we will likely do again."

Honestly I did find the stay was a little dusty, some areas like the stove and washing machine weren’t super clean, but if you’re down for a slightly rustic experience I would say this is an excellent value and has a lot of charm. Had a really nice time. I appreciate that the kitchen is really well stocked with a tea kettle, multiple pots and pans, tons of dishes and plates. The living room has movies, books, games. It felt very comfortable. Overall I do recommend it"

The Nambe Farm experience is a perfect getaway from the City into rest and relaxation, a wonderful organic farm with the best of veggies! Nina & Matt really have the farming thing going on! Plan to see them at the Farmer’s Market in Santa Fe, a great way to spend an early Saturday morning!

We were both able to work remotely with no issues, except the wifi was a bit iffy during afternoon summer storms. Despite the heat, the casita stayed cool and comfortable. We had everything we needed to cook. We loved the location -- there is unbelievable hiking/mountain biking just a few miles away.

Stayed a few nights","All I can say is magical. We were so relaxed the farm had rain for two days which brought so much joy to Nina and the delightful veggies. The peacock next door gave a feeling of another world while you slept. The proximity to downtown Santa Fe was perfect for us. Gulliver loved laying under the cover porch. Close to a nice little hiking trail up the road and a great scenic back way to Taos. We will be back. Oh and Thank You for the eggs, yummy!"

Stayed a few nights","It you’ve never seen the workings of an organic farm and all of the hard work that goes into bringing those beautiful fresh vegetables to our local farmers markets, this is this place to visit. Great location for some fun day trips as well."

Stayed a few nights","If you’re looking for a retreat that is quiet, peaceful and comfortable, yet close enough to civilization, this is the place. We had a wonderful weekend relaxing with old favorite DVD’s from the collection there, hiking in the nearby badlands, and visiting Chimayo and Santa Fe. The casita has character and offers a fenced yard for dogs.
The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare our meals. Be advised there is no microwave. All in all, a wonderful weekend!"

Stayed with kids","Our family (2 adults, 1 kid, and our dogs) had a magical stay in Nambé. The casita was perfect, quiet, and cozy, and we absolutely loved staying on the farm. We enjoyed the peace and quiet, the colorful sunsets and bright stars at night, and hiking in the Badlands. Nina and Matt were thoughtful and accommodating, and a joy to talk with. Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","Wow! What a fabulous casita! We loved our time here very much! We are so impressed with all the little ""extras"" the amazing hosts provided to make our stay perfect! We had everything we needed and are extremely satisfied!
The good news is we will definitely stay here again when we return to do more hiking and sightseeing!
The bad news - for us - is we will probably never stay in another Air BNB as amazing as Sage Casita when we travel to other places. This place is ""simply the BEST!!""
Thanks for an amazing experience! We'll be back!!"

Stayed with a pet","This property is steps away from the Rio Grande River, offering easy access to the water. And if you don't want to walk down to the water you can enjoy it from the comfort of the huge backyard deck. Home is clean and equipped with the necessary items to make your stay comfortable. Pots and pans, spices, cutlery and dishes are all available to assist with your meal plans. If grilling is your preference, this property boasts a clean propane grill that gets the job done. We enjoyed our stay and look forward to being back."

Stayed with a pet",This house is beautiful and peaceful. You get to stay right on the river and can fish or relax with the sound birds and nature all around. Our family and pup had the best trip and were in a great jump off spot to explore different areas or simply lounge under the shade trees.

Group trip","We fell in love with the Ranchito!! We had a girls' trip with 5 women and we were all just in awe of how wonderful Misty's Ranchito is. The house was spectacularly decorated, had EVERYTHING you could even dream of needing, and we felt instantly at home and lucky to have found such a lovely home to stay in. There were so many treasured little spots to lounge in and we each had our own spaces for solo time and many places to gather for meals and outdoor hang time. The kitchen was fully stocked with cooking items and spices, coffee, etc. Misty has thought of everything you might need for your stay and it truly felt magical at the Ranchito.
The location is perfect- we enjoyed hiking/running the BLM land and the views were spectacular. We were really close to Santa Fe and other amazing day trips, but we found that we just wanted to get back to hang out at the Ranchito as much as possible.
100% coming back to the Ranchito and highly recommend!"
