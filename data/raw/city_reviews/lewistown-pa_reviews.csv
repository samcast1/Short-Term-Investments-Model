We wish it were a little closer than the 45 minute drive to campus, but we felt the price fairly reflected the distance. We appreciated the cleanliness and all the special touches…a lovely home away from home!"

Group trip","Judith's house was perfect! We were there for three nights for a family wedding (me and my husband, and our three adult children). The house is welcoming with a terrific open layout which provided both togetherness & privacy. Kitchen had all we needed - we even cooked a family meal . The beds were comfortable and cozy with high end linens...and fluffy towels. There is plenty of natural light throughout the house which added to its homey feeling.
The house was so clean, from floor to ceiling and corner to corner. Topnotch appliances - including full size washer & dryer, in a laundry room ! From the second we unlocked the doo, our stay was easy, and it was ""home"". There is a Walmart - which has everything, including a huge grocery section - about a three minute drive from the house.
Lastly, Judith IS a SUPER Host! She was quick to respond with questions and suggestions . Do not hesitate to reserve this house, whether for a Penn State game, family occasion, or just a getaway."

Stayed a few nights","We were visiting our Freshman daughter at Penn State for Parent’s Weekend and this was the perfect place to stay. It is about 30 minutes to State College. As soon as we opened the front door we were impressed with a spotless, welcoming, very well decorated, comfortable home! I thought it was even more spacious than pictured. I enjoyed a bath in the large soaker tub. The beds were very comfortable. Judith was a great host and her place is well stocked with towels, toiletries, even waters in the frig which was a great touch! Judith was very quick to respond when I overlooked where the Wi-Fi password was. I would highly recommend and will book again when visiting State College."

Stayed a few nights","We had an absolutely wonderful stay at Judith's cozy cottage in Lewistown! The location was incredibly convenient, with everything you might need in case of an emergency, like Dunkin' and Walmart nearby. Plus, there are some fantastic restaurants and bars in the local area, which added to the charm of our stay.
The quick and easy drive to State College was a bonus for us, making it a great home base for our trip.
The cottage itself was a true gem. It was impeccably clean and beautifully decorated – every corner was a delight to explore. The beds were super comfy, and there was plenty of space for all of us.
Judith had thoughtfully stocked the house with everything we could possibly need, which made our stay even more enjoyable. We can't wait to return and experience this wonderful place again. Thanks, Judith, for providing such a delightful getaway!"

It had everything we needed, and would definitely recommend staying at Judith’s place again (and she was also very responsive). If you are staying in Lewistown, this is a great location near everything (although everything in a small town like this is near everything ;)."

Stayed a few nights",Overall it was a great stay and we were pleased with almost everything. It was slightly confusing to find at first because the home is apart of a 4-plex and parking was in the back. The home was very clean and was very close to the church and reception venue we were visiting. (In town for a wedding) We couldn’t figure out why our fridge wasn’t working but it was because it wasn’t turned on due to our own mistake but I kinda wish it was already running for us so make sure to check for that if you stay here. Also the bathroom door doesn’t latch. There was a stool we placed behind it to keep it shut if someone was occupying it. Other than that the stay was great and the host was helpful with instructions and we never had to reach out for further information.

Kelly had drinks and snacks available which was a nice touch."

Group trip",This is a very nice location. Love that wood is provided for a campfire. The “jacuzzi “ was a bit misleading because we first thought there was a hot tub. We did not realize that there was no TV until we arrived. Thankfully family was coming later so they brought one. I am not a TV watcher but it was college basketball weekend and what the family wanted to do. It worked out to bring our own. Overall we had a great get away .

Stayed with kids","We loved our stay at the Lazy Bass Lodge! There is so much space for your crew to spread out (especially the fabulous game room and giant primary bedroom), including outdoor seating areas that make us want to come back in warmer weather! The three individual thermostats ensured toastiness all throughout the house, and it’s a short drive to poke around the shops of Lewistown and an easy trip to State College. The kitchen is well stocked, but note there is not a dishwasher.
Highly recommend for a getaway!"

Stayed with kids","Our stay at INNteRest was awesome. All our guests enjoyed the location, the views. We were a group of 8 (5 adults and three kids) that were out for a Penn State football game. Far enough to get out of the craziness of State College on game day, but not too far to go back and forth on game day either. Plenty of basic kitchen amenities allowed us to cook a breakfast and dinner during our stay. Kids loved the game room as their little own sanctuary away from the adults. Would seriously consider another stay!"

This home was very spacious, clean and comfortable. The kitchen was very well stocked in case you wanted to cook or bake. Candy dish on table and snacks on the counter made it feel like home. The bathrooms were very clean and lots of toiletry items provided. Bedrooms were beautiful and provided a great nights rest. We enjoyed relaxing in the beautifully decorated living room. Dining room is a nice size and had a coffee bar. We did not get to enjoy the enclosed porch but it would be a wonderful place to sit in the summer. We felt so comfortable in this home and wished we could have stayed longer. Its located on a quiet back street in a charming little town. We ate at a local restaurant- Michele's Oip and had great food and live entertainment. Would definitely stay here again."

Her guesthouse was very clean, well-maintained, beautifully decorated, and tidy. We felt right at home. We had such a relaxing family time playing games, reading, putting a puzzle together, and feeding the deer. Her kitchen is well-stocked which worked great as we made most of our meals at the guesthouse. The guesthouse is situated in the beautiful Big Valley. It's true to it's name--peaceful. We wouldn't hesitate to come back again--in fact, our children are begging to go again soon. Thanks for allowing us to stay and enjoy your space!"

Stayed with kids",I am beyond thankful for Ruth & her beautiful bed and breakfast. We had a special situation where we had to stay somewhere else during the day because of getting a bathroom remodeled. My husband & I work from home with our 7 month old. She couldn’t be around the construction & we landed on staying at Ruth’s with our nanny to give our baby a silent place during the day. To say Ruth was accommodating is an understatement. We walked in to delicious breakfast items & a spotless place. I had such a peace of mind that my little one was safe playing & navigating because it was so clean & well kept. It was so helpful to have some food as we traveled back & forth from our home (to sleep at night) to the Airbnb (to word during the day). Wifi allowed me to have multiple meetings throughout the day easily and I even worked on the porch while watching the deer. If you want to stay somewhere that just feels like home - this is it. Thank you Ruth! I’m forever grateful for your place!

We were thrilled with everything!! We were in the area to visit Penn's Cave and Gita Nagari farm, and the guesthouse was very conveniently located. It's actually very close to ""city life"", but you would never know it once you're there - it seems so secluded. My kids loved playing in the little playhouse and provided toys, sleeping in the loft, having campfires, and feeding the deer. I never imagined feeding deer by hand just steps away from the door. The kitchen is well stocked, including most staples you'll need when traveling. On the drive home, we were planning our next trip already, because we can't wait to return!

Begin with the place: it’s so clean, very thing that is needed is there, the cabin itself has a very smart design - while you feel there’s ample space, every little thing you may or may not need can be found in it. Many windows and many light sources, feels really comfy day and night, whenever you want to just kick back and rest. The mattress is surprisingly comfortable and we both slept really well. First time using compost toilet but it’s really easy and clean, no problem at all. Outside the cabin there’s bbq grill and fire pit, literally everything a cabin needs. A little stream is right there in front of the cabin, and the sound of water can be heard all night (if window is opened), it feels really nice.
Apart front the amazing stay, Kristen’s parents who co-hosted us went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. Our car got stuck in the mud and they came back all the way from town to help us drag the car out. Seeing me walking in the mud in my sneakers, they offered me a pair of boots to keep my food dry. They even invited us and helped us to use their hose to wash off the mud, and helped wiping the car clean, and showed us around their property. Really nice people and beautiful little cabin. That’s why I immediately booked my next trip there, even before I got time to write the review."

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely loved the Cabin in the Cove! It was lovelier than we could've hoped for! As soon as we arrived, it felt like coming home. Everthing you could possibly need for your stay was provided, and the cabin was spotlessly clean. Booking with our host Melissa was quick and easy, and check in was a breeze. Our co hosts Dan and Melissa were so very kind and helpful as well, and were always readily available to answer our questions. The location is just perfect, surrounded by woods on three sides, and down the driveway, an open meadow where we enjoyed seeing a flock of wild turkeys and several deer. The meadow was also perfect for some wonderful stargazing, just a few steps down the driveway. We loved the firepit and grill too. Such a peaceful, quiet setting, but only a quick 10-15 minute drive to town for groceries, shops and restaurants. We only wish we could have stayed longer, and we can't wait to return next year!

Cabin in the Cove is simple and rustic, cozy and efficient and a super comfortable place. We absolutely loved it here and will most likely be back. Melissa (mom) and Kristen, the hosts are amazing at communication. We had several questions on how to operate the grill and details about the composting toilet. Melissa not only answered our questions immediately but stopped by to show us how to use the grill and Dan, the dad, even offered to help us build a fire in the fire pit. We built our own bonfires every night and cooked our meals in them which was fantastic.
You don't need to have contact with the hosts if you don't want. Everything is there for you to have a comfortable stay."

Stayed with kids","this was our first time with Airbnb, we were looking for anything anywhere and found this Gem on a 4th of July weekend. We were extremely happy cause we needed to get away for a couple of day.
the Price was excellent, the place was super clean and as described, actually we found it to be more than what we expected. away from the hustle and bustle but not too far in. Ice cream was just about 10 min away, etc. Kristen and her mom is always there via text and phone if you have any question or concerns and the creek is so much fun for the kids. This tiny house had every thing under the sun almost. lots of space, we were 4 of us and still had an extra bed to spare. TV has like 1200 channels and Wifi was great. Fire place was easy to get started. We really loved this tiny house and my bosslady was so happy we decided to rent it.
we adjusted quickly to the new concept of compose toilet. great idea btw. we would love to go back and cozy up again."

When I got there the fire pit was ready to go with kindle and logs and that was a wonderful thoughtful touch. The creek by the fire pit and picnic table makes the outdoor very relaxing. I think it is important to know that the road is fairly close (not very busy but you can hear it and see it) and the main house is also fairly close so its not super private but I never saw or heard folks. Thanks so much Kristen for answering all my questions and for the hospitality.

Stayed over a week","This was the best Airbnb i have ever booked. nice stocked kitchen. incredible private hiking trail. easy check in. It is 5 star on all the usual metrics used to evaluate an Airbnb stay. However its the kindness and authenticity of the hosts that really makes this Airbnb unforgettable. I arrived a few days before Thanksgiving and decided to take some downtime from work so i didnt check my emails, but the day after Thanksgiving I saw that the host had messaged me inviting me to join their family Thanksgiving dinner. Wow! thats an incredibly generous kind act of highest type right there. i belatedly responded thanking host. Next, its a knock on the door same day. Surprise! one of Hosts adorable children hands me best consolation prize ever its a tin foil wrapped plate of gourmet homemade holiday cookies. Then Host lends me her charming super cool trail running husband for unforgettable hiking tour. A day before i leave, a knock at door, a cherub hands me Christmas card f/Host! WOW!!"

This was a great location and an ideal place for my family to hang out Saturday evening after the game to continue to enjoy my daughter's birthday and Sunday before needing to go back to Harrisburg for the return flight. Rebekah was gracious enough to allow an extended checkout Sunday so we could continue to enjoy family time! Great weekend and a very thoughtful host with food provided to enjoy a Sunday brunch!

But last minute we invited my 88 year old mother along on our trip, she grew up in an old farmhouse and this house had many of the same characteristics and that brought back many memories for her and it was wonderful to hear those memories. The concern with having an older person with us in this house was steep steps leading to the bathroom and bedrooms. Keep this in mind if you are inviting someone who has a greater risk of falling."

Stayed a few nights","The farmhouse is exactly what you would expect. An old 1800s farmhouse right next to a corn field. It has charm, character, and crooked floors. The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable and everything was clean and nicely decorated. The bathroom was fully remodeled, and the kitchen has modern fixtures. The decor was very appropriate for an old farm house. The view of the morning mist rising over the corn field was serene. It is close to the highway (which was very convenient, but you could hear cars when sitting on the screen porch -- which was probably the only negative). We slept quite well while we were there. We had some things to discuss with Lauren, the owner, and she was extremely responsive and just lovely to deal with. We were here for Penn State's family weekend, and the 1/2-hour drive to campus was easy. Highly recommended for a visit to the State College area. Priced very reasonably. A lovely stay. Thanks Lauren!"

Stayed a few nights","One of the cleanest Airbnbs I've ever booked. Everything was neat and easy to find and the place was very cozy. We slept really well and enjoyed the snacks and well-stocked coffee and tea bar. This host goes above and beyond most other hosts I've experienced. Felt very private despite nearby homes. Super great value for the money. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.
Also recommend OIP restaurant nearby for pizza and sandwiches which was just a short drive away. We picked up from there twice and the food was awesome."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay here was fantastic. Brooke’s cottage felt like home. She left a binder full of places to see and things to do that was super helpful to get to know the area. The cottage was very clean and comfortable and the coffee bar was a great bonus! Brooke went the extra mile to make sure we had everything we needed, including linens. The check in and out process was also very easy. The bridge to get to the home was a little intimidating at first and it can be easy to miss the initial turn into the neighborhood but after the first time, it was no big deal. This was a great stay!"

Overall, it’s a lovely place that would suit a smaller group well."

I spent the entire evening sitting in a rocking chair on the front porch, listening to the frogs croak and looking at the stars. The only minor drawback was the gravel road getting in off the main road. The approach was kind of steep and we had a fully packed, very heavy minivan. Other than that everything was great. I would stay here again in a heartbeat."

Stayed with kids","Brooke’s place is quite clean. The furniture and decor is all put together nicely. The house is definitely a little older, but they have done well with the space. As some other reviews have stated, the house is not really private and is centered in a group of 4 or 5 other different residences. Our biggest disappointment though, was that we thought the listing implied that we would be able to see the creek from the porch. We could not. You do cross the creek as you get close to the house on the small bridge others have mentioned, and it is likely visible from some of the neighboring houses. The creek does not run in front of the house but we could not see it from the porch. All that being said, we were grateful for a clean space that could accommodate 6 of us, and our kids enjoyed learning about the fly fishing decor."

The bathroom was spotless which is always important to me. It was a good home base for our activities. The houses surrounding the cottage were a little closer than I thought they would be - it was hard to tell from the pictures on airbnb but I was thinking it would be a bit more private but besides that it was a great stay!

Stayed a few nights","The cottage is very relaxing, immaculate, and feels just like home with all the amenities provided. Brooke was very clear on directions to the cottage. We thoroughly enjoyed the front porch during the summer rains during our stay. The cottage is not as private as expected since there are other homes close by on the right and left that are not pictured. However, the little area of homes is quiet overall, particularly as it’s nestled past the creek crossing, and did not detract from the peacefulness of our stay. So, it’s a peaceful spot but definitely not secluded. It is within 10 minutes of the amenities of town but had the feel of being “out” and away. Host provided a binder of local recommendations of activities and restaurants etc which was helpful. We really enjoyed eating at JP Edwards Bar and Grill, twice! (Good food/good prices). The cottage was the perfect size for us two college besties to stay although it can sleep up to 6. The kitchen seating is a tight fit for more than 2."

All of the amenities provided allow you the ability to not even have to leave if you don't want, or need to Brooke is incredibly communicative, always responds quickly, and is incredibly kind. If you are lucky enough to stay in the cottage, on the side road, heading up to the cabin, stop if you can and take in the absolute beauty of the mountain you're driving up to. My only wish is that I had been able to stay another night. As long as I'm able, I'll be back, every March, to that little cabin, on the side of a beautiful mountain."

The one thing I would mention is that upon entry, the house had a pretty strong smell of what seemed like maybe a previous smoker. We were able to open the windows and air it out a little, and it probably wouldn't bother many people, but both my friend who stayed with me and I have asthma, and are sensitive to that smell, so it's just something to consider if that bothers you. The house was spotless, warm, cozy, and had everything we needed otherwise. Brooke was very nice and helpful, and the stay was great."

Stayed a few nights","I took this weekend solo for some self care and the cottage did not disappoint. I had a really great time. It was quiet, and no distractions. the cottage is lovely and comfortable. Brooke was incredibly easy to reach for any questions or concerns. I of course picked a weekend that we got a snow storm, but she was very gracious in allowing me extra time to stay past checkout if needed. Thankfully I did not and was able to leave on time. I would absolutely come back for another solo, hideaway, weekend of quiet self care again. Which I'm hoping will be sooner rather than later. Also, the bridge can be daunting, but it is easily doable. If I can do it with some snow and ice... you can absolutely do it too. Just take it slow and you will be fine. Thank you again for a great weekend."

Stayed one night","This was the perfect find for our trip. My family and I wanted a safe, quiet place to stay. This was the perfect spot. The cottage is comfortable and CLEAN and we loved the country, small town feel.
When we stayed it was a cold weekend. However, the house heated up perfectly! The Roku TV and WiFi were both easy to figure out and made the perfect way to unwind after a long day. Plus, the host also left some snacks when we arrived; the perfect way to welcome us.
The host is also what makes this AirBnB a great place to stay. She will be happy to answer questions and communicates quickly. She even went above and beyond. The morning of our checkout was accompanied by terrible weather (freezing rain). However, Brooke was proactive and on top of it. She reached out to us in a timely manner the morning of checkout and communicated we could shelter there until conditions approved. Part of this was just luck no reservations were made for later that day. HOWEVER, the care for the safety of their guests and the quality service to the AirBnB is what shown through.
We recommend and would definitely stay again!"

Stayed one night","This was the perfect find for our trip out into Western PA. The cottage is quite simple but very comfortable, and exactly what we were looking for in a place to stay. At the time of our booking, it was also the only full home rental we could find in the area - most other options we came across were single rooms or going to a full blown hotel (both not really for us!).
A few things that really helped enhance our stay: great heating/cooling in the house that is easy to control, nice board game selection, the Roku TV was easy to use, and the host also left some local treats and waters for us - a sweet little addition.
We will definitely be revisiting in the future if we have to travel to this area again."

Stayed a few nights","The house was amazing and was somewhat like the photos. The reason I say somewhat is because there are 3 rooms in the home that has “owner access only”, which is fine it’s your house however one of those “owners access only” is in one of the bedrooms and the other is in the hallway of the bedrooms, the third is the basement I assume. Also there was a shed or possibly a guest house. Again the house was great it was just a little creepy with knowing there are doors locked and one in a room that you would be sleeping. It made my family and I feel very uncomfortable to the point we all slept in the living room floor. I just think that if there are rooms that guest does not have access to that information should disclosed. Also none of the photos posted does not show “owner access only”."

We got in late Friday night after the race & were so greatful to have booked somewhere that was easy to find, parking onsite & easy access into the home. Once inside we were so amazed with the thought and details put into this home. It was very clean and homey with a welcome note & cookies from the host. The bed was very comfortable with fresh linens. Plenty of towels in the bathroom with shampoo, conditioner & body wash in the shower like the hotels have now in containers. They had makeup remover wipes which I thought was really nice to make sure the towels and sheets look their best for future guests. There was also a hair dryer available. We didn't cook there but appreciated the full size fridge to keep items we purchased to take home & the Keurig to make coffee on the morning. There were coffee mugs, silverware, dish soap, dish rags & towels in the kitchen."

The loft was clean and cozy, linens were soft, and the bed was comfortable. The apartment itself is beautiful and my dog and I felt comfortable and welcome.
A few things to note, that are not negative, but good reminders: this is an upstairs unit, so there is a steep set of steps upon entering the front door (not a big deal, but good to know if you’re traveling with heavy items or have physical limitations). There is also no TV in the unit, but the wifi is just fine for streaming on a laptop!"

Stayed a few nights","This was our first experience with an Air BNB- the apartment was very clean, comfortable and quiet. We were attending an event near Penn State and access to the highway system was fast. It was very nice to spend the night in a quiet apartment with plenty of room for the two of us after a hectic day. Ellen is a gracious host and provided several nice additional touches including a welcome basket with snacks and a fridge with sodas and juice. The bathroom had a basket with toiletries available if we forgot anything!
Ellen has set the bar for our expectations for another BNB!"

I even forgot to buy oil one night for a dinner we were going to cook, and Ellen kindly offered oil with no charge almost immediately after I asked if she had any. The airbnb is beautiful and well cared for. We felt at peace and very safe. We honestly wish we could have stayed longer! 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area or even just looking for a quiet getaway!"

Stayed one night","Pro's of Ellen's place: Quiet, neat indoors, many basics offered (cold water/soda), small bagged snacks, coffee K-cups, bathroom necessities
In need of attention: Linens on bed were very worn (much pilling on sheets and pillow covers), bathroom sink was quite slow to drain
In summary, Ellen's place, as my husband stated, ""met our needs"""

I suspect in rain, snow, ice the drive is considerably longer. The unit was easy to find, easy to get into and very clean. The host was easy to get a hold of and very responsive. We had an issue with the hot water which was resolved in minutes. The kitchen is adequate to store and cook food, the living area big enough and the bedroom is comfortable. The host provided a very nice basket of snacks, apples and soft drinks. We will consider renting again if the need arises."

Although I only used the coffee maker and microwave, the kitchen is one of the largest AirBNB kitchens I have seen for an apartment. So if you like to cook this would be a great choice for you. There are several large supermarkets nearby as well. The hosts were super accommodating as well and allowed me to check in early since the apartment was ready."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Michelle's place over a weekend to attend a Penn State football game. Everything was just as pictured and Michelle has really done a good job of providing everything you need and more, which was much appreciated. We had no problems checking in, and parking right outside the door is always nice. We were very comfortable, slept well, and the location worked out great for getting to the game. I think Michelle says it well with ""keep it simple"" as this isn't a trendy or fancily decorated space, but having an entire apartment with a full kitchen (and washer and dryer if you need it) made this place an amazing value. Several nearby restaurants were an added bonus. We would definitely stay again. Thanks for a very comfortable visit, Michelle!"

Stayed a few nights","Rebecca hosted my son and his girlfriend for the weekend, and it was a short but very nice stay. They reported it was clean and comfortable, and easy to find. Rebecca was a fantastic host. The first evening my son turned the oven on to make a pizza without checking the inside first, and wound up melting a plastic cutting board all over the oven. Rebecca was nothing if not gracious and concerned more for him not being able to use the oven again than for her future job of getting the plastic off the racks and heating element. Communication was excellent, and I would definitely recommend this property and host."

Stayed one night","If you are looking for a peaceful place to stay in the Belleville, PA
area, I suggest you check out Tranquil Trella. It's a homey and welcoming apartment in the lower part of a beautiful brick house. It has its own entrance with parking right in front of the walkway to the apartment. The kitchen is fully equipped and there is ample living space.
I would recommend it to anyone as it is such a quiet and peaceful area. The apartment is super clean and has everything you will need. Much better than a hotel room!"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay was too short to enjoy Rebecca's lovely airbnb. I definitely recommend staying here and would do so again if I have a chance. It is very spacious and Rebecca's decorated it for comfort. The books and games were really a fun idea.
Rebecca has stocked the kitchen with pots, pans and necessary utensils to make meals. In the cupboards we found easy to make meals, coffee, creamers, and several other delicious looking treats. Having a full size refrigerator and oven was very helpful. I was able to have breakfast made with ease with how well the kitchen was shocked.
There is a spacious laundry room available.
The beds are comfortable much nicer than staying at a hotel. The cost was much less than staying a weekend at a hotel.
Belleville is a beautiful little town I especially enjoyed hearing and seeing the Amish buggies travel throughout the countryside. Staying four days was not enough time to see all sights.
We were there to attend my grandson's wedding and were so busy helping make his and his bride's day special. If you get a chance to stay at Rebecca's airbnb take a couple extra days so you have time to go sightseeing.
Thank you again Rebecca for making our stay welcoming and comfortable."

Stayed over a week","I was here for a month, and if you ever wanted to experience the Amish, Belleville is the place to be. Along the main drag, even the surrounding neighborhood, you'll see men, women, and children steering their horses and buggies around town. The 'clip-clop' is synonymous with slow moving moving traffic. Beware when attempting to bypass them. At night, look for the red flashing lights. You'll soon realize it's very easy to sneak up on them. The neighborhood itself is quiet. You're not far from a Sheetz, or Dollar General. There's a coffee shop that serves breakfast called, ""Taste of the Valley."" Another that serves Penn State ice cream called, ""Hostetlers."" The place itself is clean. It's in the basement. I'm a night nurse and having gotten enough sleep during my stay says a lot. There's a television with roku. The beds are comfy. They remind me of the ones at Best Western. Laundry is easily accessible. And both the refrigerator and stove are in good working order. Rebecca was a wonderful host. She was there to accomodate all of my needs. She's very responsive and thoughtful. She dropped off some goodies during Easter as if there weren't enough already. It was nice to find snacks and a bottle of wine waiting my first night there."

Stayed a few nights","This beautiful basement apartment was absolutely perfect in every way ! I actually could not find one thing that was lacking … you walk in and I felt at ease and at home .. and that was just from the way it has been decorated .. a warm cozy country farmhouse feel. But once you actually lay in the beds it takes you to a whole other level of cozy and comfort … bedding was beautiful and comfortable bed was soft and warm and relaxing … I honestly had the best sleep of my life on the mattress … then we sat on the sofas and again they are as comfortable as any sofa could be ! Big closet space and the nice clean bathroom was perfect , loved the shower spray ! Rebecca also has supplied the entire space with pretty much anything one would need we didn’t have to ask for anything at all The refrigerator even had some breakfast items and a bottle
Of wine .. ! Floors were warm and the fireplace ambience was the best !! It’s a real fireplace with warm brick ( not a working fireplace ) but it had a realistic log flames insert that emitted heat and it was just as pretty as a real fire. My Best Friend and I came here for some rest, relaxation, renewal … we were hopeful that we would have zero frustrations that normally accompany life in general … and that is absolutely what we got !!! Peaceful Tranquil and Comfort !! It doesn’t hurt either the incredible area .. a gorgeous Valley surrounded by beautiful farms and mountains that seem to hug you as you travel around town. Great places to eat very nearby as well !
You will not be disappointed here at Tranquil Trella … it’s impossible !
I will be back here for sure."

They were very responsive to our needs and even came a distance at 9pm on Saturday night to let us in when we came back and couldn't find our key. If we get to the area again we would stay here especially in nicer weather to enjoy the back porch and yard. We were there on a cold, rainy weekend. Thanks Rebecca and Adam."

The bed was beyond comfy and the whole home was cozy. My child and I loved all the board games that Rebecca supplied. The neighborhood is so quaint and quiet. We got to see lots of Amish horse and carriages go down the street. It was an easy half hour drive to Huntingdon where we went for parents weekend. I'd definitely return to Tranquil Trella!

Rebecca was really great to communicate with and easy to reach. The rooms are stocked with little trinkets and games (it's a perfect house for a family with children to stay in), and the house itself is on a beautiful, quiet, safe street.
I had a fabulous meal at Richies OIP (recommended by Rebecca in her welcome booklet). Belleville is such a lovely farm town.....definitely worth stopping in if you are driving through central PA"
