Stayed a few nights","Had a short 5-day stay - I wanted something other than a mouldy hotel and this place was lovely. Hunter was friendly & helpful + gave clear instructions for check-in.
The cottage was clean, beautifully decorated and well-equipped. The surroundings were peaceful.
I 100% recommend it, it's such a cute little cottage."

The furnishings were tasteful, the bedding and towels were better than many 4 star hotels, and the coffee was ready to go! I wouldn't hesitate to book again."

Stayed about a week","We had a wonderful stay at Hunters. We did have to work remotely during our stay and appreciated the one work place. Would have been helpful to have another table but we made it work. Beds and linens were comfortable and was refreshing to have towels that weren't thin and worn out from previous guests. Check the kitchenware, several plates, glasses and silverware not cleaned well. That, of course, is not reflective of Hunter but more so the previous guests. Should the cleaning people have to spot check that? I don't know."

Stayed with kids","This cottage was so charming! We only stayed overnight while traveling from North Carolina to Louisiana, but we really enjoyed our stay. The area was so quiet and beautiful after being in the car for 10 hours. We loved seeing the kids next-door and across the street playing outside, it made us feel at home and safe. Neighbors were friendly. You can tell Hunter really took pride in the updates and charm of the house. It was the perfect size for my husband, our son, and myself. We were super close to the gas station and a Walgreens (we needed some sinus medication once we got there). And checkout / cleanup was super easy and low maintenance. Would highly recommend if you need a place to stay in the area. We even talked about wanting to move here, it was beautiful!"

Stayed one night","Hunter’s Coldwater Cottage was a beautiful home. Immediately upon arrival we could see how manicured the lawn and surroundings were, so we knew the inside of the home would be the same. We surely were not disappointed! We did have a question for Hunter even before arriving, and he was very quick to respond. The inside of the cottage was decorated so cute, well-appointed, and had all the necessary tools we needed to prepare our meals. Having dinner on the back porch and enjoying the beautiful backyard while we had dinner was a real bonus! We absolutely would stay at the Coldwater Cottage again if our travels take us through Anniston. Thank you, Hunter!"

We will be telling our Florida biking friends about it, would come back any time."

Great way to just get away and feel like your on vacation while not really being to far from what you know. Peaceful, calm, nothing to worry about. It's clean and hunter was a great host. Will be back probably next weekend. Might make this our new monthly vacation spot just to get away from what we know and relax. My first Airbnb experience, but will not be my last.

As I was working from home during my stay I especially appreciated the high speed internet (about 200 mb/s download and 20 mb/s upload speeds), and the dedicated workspace. Can’t beat the fenced in backyard and quiet neighborhood when traveling with a dog either.
The host also provided recommendations to check out in the area, and he was very responsive and communicative throughout my stay. 5/5 across the board from me."

To cook a meal. Perfect place to stop if you are traveling or in the area for an event or to visit! The outdoor space was wonderful and relaxing on the patio with an outdoor fountain. There is an area with a fire pit and chairs we didn’t use but would be perfect for roasting hot dogs or s’mores or just hanging out. I will stay here again and recommend. Hunter is a great host!"

The kitchen had decent quality dishes and utensils and was well stocked and easy to cook in. The bathrooms did not have shampoo or soap in the showers, or any blow dryers. Overall, it was a lovely house and a comfortable stay."

Stayed with kids",Overall it is a nice historic house with nicely done updates on the kitchen and bathroom. The only problem was that one of the fans in the master bedroom didn't work and 2 of the bedroom doors did not lock. Be aware of the half bath because you will be locked in if you close the door and need someone to let you out. I messaged Hunter about the door locks and fan but did not received any response. There were cornhole boards but no bean bags to go with it. Sorry kids. Overall it's a nice house and close to the center of town but just needs some attention to the basics from the property management.

Stayed a few nights","In fairness, the listing is pretty accurate. We were caught off guard by the lack of soap, shampoo, toothpaste, paper towels, toilet paper, etc. The pictures are nice but the house is 100 years old, along with everything that entails. Bidets are a nice touch. It is right off a main road. And I mean right off the main road. All of the beds are saggy and super unsupportive. It was adequate for a basic stay for a few of us guys, who’ve roughed it plenty (after a trip to Walmart for supplies)."

The house was very clean and very well decorated. The floors were clean and new and the walls appeared to be freshly painted. The house is in an older neighborhood but it was a quiet neighborhood. We didn't use the pool out back as it is winter, but it looks like a nice little area that they have created. I was happy with everything about this house and I will definitely stay there again if I have a need to be in the area. Thank you Tarisha for welcoming us to your home."

Stayed a few nights","What a wonderful stay! The accommodations were exactly as depicted in photos and descriptions. The host(s) were very responsive to all communications and checked on us during our stay to offer any assistance. The unit itself was beautifully appointed with all amenities (coffee bar, toiletries, etc.) one could expect. (There was even an extra toothbrush and toothpaste for those forgetful travelers.). The unit was very quiet to any outside noises. I especially appreciated the plush bath towels. All in all, a great experience; one would absolutely recommend to any fellow traveler."

Gwen not only communicated quickly, but the place was so perfect for my sister and I to enjoy morning coffee and cry before the funeral. The night before check-out Gwen sent us a message that she blacked out the day not wanting us to rush checking out. It wasn’t just a warm and cozy place…the host went above requirements to love on my family in our grief.
Highly recommend this location and host.
Thank you, Gwen.
We are so grateful.

We loved the simple decor which made the home feel uncluttered and added to the cleanliness of it all. Close to major retailers and restaurants with a short drive to Oxford for additional shopping and eating options. Gwen was also a friendly host, very quick to respond to any questions we had and gave clear instructions for check in and check out procedures. We would definitely stay again should the need arise!"

Stayed a few nights","Jason and Gwen were outstanding hosts and communications were very responsive. We traveled from Iowa to visit our daughter in Anniston, Alabama and didn't want the hotel scene.
Everything was perfect for us. We even met them in person (at our invite) and they truly care about the upkeep of their home. We offered one suggestion about placing a king bed versus a queen bed in the master bedroom and they informed us they would be doing that!
We are sometimes hesitant to be guests at an AirBNB as you never know how the pictures and stated amenities will be until one arrives.
Jason and Gwen deserve the accolades of being Superhosts!
We look forward to staying again if it's available the next time we visit.
We own a Rock Shop in Iowa and our tag line is ... Rock on! This home is a rockin' it.
Thanks for everything!"

The outside sitting area is beautiful, and it will be even nicer once the trees that are planted get established. We were so close to downtown, and there is an awesome plant nursery right down the road with a huge selection and great prices. The self storage is right next door which we hadn't planned on, but there are trees planted that will help with that in time. Beautiful skies, and we were able to see the stars at night. Would highly recommmend this for a couple or someone who is needing somewhere to stay for work in the Anniston/Oxford area."

Tori was very helpful and gracious as I navigated through serious spring storms and tornado warning which delayed my arrival.
I would definitely stay again if I return to this area."

She made her place family friendly- from thoughtful touches like coloring books and crayons to cups with lids and straws to nightlights, she thought of it all! Traveling with a family takes a lot of effort, and her great coffee bar with variety of goodies and was a blessing. We only got to stay one night, so having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash was great to not have to pack and avoid the mess of that! We loved the home; it’s been beautifully redone and is very tasteful. The space was immaculate and clean and crisp, while also being comfy and cozy! The beds were all fabulous and the pillows and bedding were nice as well! Julie allowed us to come in a bit early and that was a blessing to not have to kill time with 4 kids in a place we where we were unfamiliar. She was very responsive and always helpful and kind! We would gladly stay again in a heartbeat!!"

Stayed one night","Lovely place with all new finishes. Bedrooms and bathrooms close together so all have easy access. Great nights sleep. I love AirBnBs for family travel. Everyone gets their own bed and own room at a price comparable to two hotel rooms. It is so much easier and more comfortable to be in a lovely home like this together.
Don’t let the map scare you off. A place between two highways may make you shy away, but I can assure you that it is a comfortable neighborhood tucked back between trees/hills. You can hear the highway, but it is just a low hum that is almost unnoticeable, even from outside."

Not to mention all the small touches this airbnb offers - a closet of games, extra cleaning supplies, flavored coffee creamer, a little snack basket, travel shampoos/conditioner, an arrange of chargers, etc. Gary, himself, was great to ""work"" with. He was responsive, kind, and overall very accommodating. 100% recommend this place and can't wait to stay again."

We have zero complaints and no suggestions for improvement… as I said, it was perfect! The only hiccup we experienced was of our own doing when my oldest son accidentally locked us out in the middle of the night. Julie immediately responded and guided me through the process of easily locating the spare key. Disaster was averted! The added personal touch of roses and wine to help commiserate our wedding was so kind and thoughtful. The entire experience was 5 stars from start to finish. Thank you, Julie!"

Stayed with kids","My entire family thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. It was plenty comfortable for my family of 6. The pricing was competitive with local hotels, and the house was much more comfortable than anything that a hotel could offer. Julie has really put a lot of effort into having everything a visitor could want. It is an older house, but has been fully remodeled inside, so everything is in good working condition, and the house is immaculately clean. There is plenty of room for kids to run around in the back yard. The kids really enjoyed the Nintendo system (they wish that there was a second controller, but they were plenty happy with what they had) as our kids really hadn't played video games before so they spent most the time at the house playing Super Mario brothers. They also loved the quirky string chair. The neighborhood was very quite and convenient to lots of restaurants and the interstate. If we ever return to the area, we would definitely look to stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","For a family of 6 looking to explore the Oxford, Anniston, and Talladega areas, this is perfect. There were four adults in our group.
We were unsure what to expect after we received Julie's phone call saying the previous guest had left a mess and they weren't sure they could fix it all by check-in time, but they did. I couldn't tell anything had been wrong until switching a light tripped the breaker. I called Julie right away and we figured out how to resolve that problem and it didn't happen again.
We didn't cook there as we ate leftovers from restaurants and snacks, but the kitchen is fully functional and we appreciated the water and ice machine on the fridge.
Nearby in Oxford is a huge entertainment place where we raced on go-carts and played laser tag. We didn't have time for mini-golf, bowling or the other things that were at the event location.
We also took a trip to Cheaha State Park and hiked the trails."

She responded quickly anytime I had a question, and provided above and beyond my expectations! We showed up to snacks, fully stocked coffee bar, and she even had a basket of in “case you forgot” which had anything you could think of! Lint roller, razors, hair spray, you name it and she has thought of it! Thanks so much Julie! Next time we are in town to visit, you know where to find us! The Glen Davis Place ❤️ 🏡"

Stayed with kids","Our stay was nothing shy of perfect. Ms. Julie was an Amazing host. She promptly and kindly responded to all of our inquiries and left no i undotted or t uncrossed. The entire experience was Southern Hospitality at its best! From easy to forget essentials to all the resources needed for enjoying time with family both in-and-out doors, Ms. Julie had everything we needed to feel right at home. The Glen Davis Place was clean, the beds and couches more than comfortable. Everyone, from our 4 year old granddaughter to our 86 year old father, felt right at home. The property grounds and surrounding neighborhood was beautiful. We kept the windows open and enjoyed spending hours each day either on the front porch greeting neighbors or on the back patio just enjoying the scenery. Every time we visit, this will be our “Alabama home” as my son has so affectionately named it. We look forward to our next visit and are grateful to have found such a gem."

Stayed a few nights","I found Jill's home when looking for a place to stay during a business event in Talladega. I had cut it close thanks to my procrastination, so all our locations during previous stays were already booked. She provided clear and simple instructions, which allowed us to find the home on the first pass.
Jill's work renovating the home was excellent *kudos* to her! The home may look small, but it is a very comfortable and clean home in a quiet neighborhood; it felt safe. The home is perfectly situated to allow you to get to either Oxford or Talladega easily, and it is conveniently located with restaurants or grocery stores just a short drive.
I recommend her home if you're going to be in that neck of the woods; my only hesitation is that by doing so, someone else may grab it before I do the next time I'm there. Don't procrastinate. Her home is a gem!"

I would highly recommend this place! Quit neighborhood, home was super clean and spacious, location was perfect. We were greatly impressed with the cleanliness and amenities of this home and loved having so much space. Beds were very comfortable. When I say comfortable I mean memory foam comfortable. All of the bathrooms had good essentials. There were plenty of extra towels, wash cloth, even makeup removal cloths (which I love). Can’t recommend this place enough- it was the perfect accommodation for our group, looking to book again in the next few months."

Beds are comfortable two of the bedrooms do not have tv. No sitting area for outside but the game room was awesome. The only thing I would say could be better is that the kitchen is not stocked very well it needs more bowls and definitely different pots and pans everything sticks. Other than that it is a beautiful home.

Also really convenient that Vamsi had Netflix, Disney+ and other subscriptions for us to watch as a family! (: All in all, would 100% stay here again!

The house is on a busy road and you can hear the road noise in the main living area. The master bedroom is in the back of the house and you couldn’t hear it there which was good. It is noted in the profile when I looked again in detailed description.

Stayed with a pet","This was by far the homiest and nicest Airbnb we have ever been to! It was beautifully decorated for Christmas, it had a huge beautiful backyard that made waking up in the morning so peaceful. The beautiful wooden deck with the huge backyard (enclosed) was peaceful. Vamsi was so helpful, kind, friendly, fast to respond to any questions. The inside of the house was BEAUTIFUL! It looked recently renovated, the heater worked well for winter. When we arrived (at night) the place was easy to find as it was lit up, unlike other airbnbs we have been to. This neighbor was safe, yes it’s on a main road but I couldn’t hear the traffic in the house. You can tell the owner put a lot of thought and care into this home. We even arrived to snacks and waters, which was nice after a long drive. Shampoo and body wash and plenty of towels. The couch and recliner were comfy, they have plenty of games for families. Cant wait to stay here again!"

Home was very clean and was provided more than basic amenities. I.e. laundry soap, seasonings coffee & filters. We brought our own but ran short the last day we were there & these items came to the rescue so we didn’t have to shop again when we were focusing on packing.
I will definitely recommend and book his place again when I back in the area!!
Ps, ladies… keep in mind that there is only 1 TV in the home should you be traveling with others who insist on watching sports. :)

Stayed a few nights","Really a wonderful place close to Cheaha State Park. The place had all the amenities we needed, including sharp knives! (Why don’t most Airbnbs have those??) Our only issue was that the place had a lot of air fresheners, but Vamsi was very responsive and we simply removed them for our stay. The place was extremely clean, with lots of thoughtful touches (including an electric tea kettle) and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We’d definitely love to come back!"

It had everything we needed to make a simple cooked meal for ourselves and unwind after a long day on the road. Vamsi kindly left us a bottle of sparkling wine and snacks, which was very helpful. Our kids really enjoyed playing with the card games and coloring in the coloring books. The beds were comfortable and the bathrooms were nicely stocked with toiletries (like shampoo and body wash). If we need to stop through Oxford again, we will definitely stay here!"

The furniture is comfortable, and the whole place was so clean. A welcome basket of goodies awaited us at this quiet location. The motion detector lighting in the carport and in the house made returning at night a breeze. We will definitely look to book this house again at Thanksgiving next year."

Stayed a few nights","As a teacher, I will say this place earned an A+. It was affordable, spotless, and very conveniently located. I was extremely impressed with the appearance and scent upon arrival and could see we were provided with many necessities for our stay. We were able to enjoy two simple and peaceful journeys to Talladega National Forest for hiking; it was less than 20 miles away. Many restaurants, gas stations, and stores are located within 5 - 10 minutes, which was a major convenience for our getaway. I have ZERO complaints and would definitely recommend this listing to others. Also, I would book this place again. Score: 100% : )"

Stayed with kids","Short story: BOOK IT! The owners have gone to great lengths to make this home welcoming and relaxing. We would stay here again.
Long story: This home is nestled in a beautiful country like neighborhood. The neighborhood felt safe! It’s less than 5 miles away from a variety of restaurants, shopping locations and the highway. The home is very clean and welcoming. We arrived in the evening and it was already dark outside. It was a pleasant surprise to find that soft lighting was on inside the house and ready to receive us. Check in instructions were easy to follow. House rules were posted with helpful info. There were even instructions on how to use the thermostat. Bonus points for a fridge stocked with condiments one might need, soap, lotions and q-tips provided. Cozy decor, books, and board games make one feel like they’re visiting old friends. My only regret was not arriving earlier to fully enjoy all that the home has to offer including the cutest most relaxing backyard. The owners are very quick to respond and very friendly. My boys were ready to move in and call it home! Can’t say enough good things about our stay here!"

Stayed a few nights","The inside of this cabin is beautifully made with real wood, updated open concept rustic farmhouse feel. There is ample room, comfortable furniture, and excellent wifi. Outdoors is surrounded by beautiful countryside. The area is quiet, peaceful, and private. Getting in and out is super easy. If you're looking for a laid back relaxed unwinding atmosphere, then look no further. Gas stations and country restaurants are a 5 minute drive away. There is ample parking that generously accommodates vehicles with boats, trailers, etc. The kitchen is big enough to prep food and cook easily. Be prepared to bring your own spices/seasonings, food, snacks, drinks, etc. Pots/pans and dishes are aplenty. The AC/heat unit works quickly, easy, and the airflow from room to room circulates well. Your kids (and you), will love the high speed internet and wifi here. The bedroom comes with extra pillows/blankets and even a box fan (which was a lovely bonus). This was such a lovely relaxed stay for us."

We had a great time dining and shopping at the many picker places. The home was super clean and comfortable. The linens were soft, and the bed was very comfortable. We had a few questions for our host, who replied right away. The area was well lit at night, quiet and relaxed. We would highly recommend!"

This area of Alabama is beautiful and it was perfect for us. We appreciated the white noise maker as the walls are thin. Reagan was extremely helpful working with us to figure out the DirecTV box as the internet is not quite strong enough and reliable for streaming TV. The washer and dryer were fantastic and beyond convenient, as well as the kitchen as we cooked in every night. We are looking forward to staying again if we are ever in the area. Big thank you to Reagan and Jason."

Stayed over a week","I stayed here for a 5 week clinical rotation and overall I had a great experience. Reagan and Jason were wonderful hosts and were always ready to help if I needed something. The place is brand new, decorated well, and very well taken care of. Only downside I would say is that the cell service can be spotty at times because of the location. I have Verizon and found that FaceTime was very laggy but phone calls usually worked. This airbnb is located in a very quiet area, not surrounded by too much but Oxford and Jacksonville are only 15-20mins away. The walls to the airbnb are really thin but I used a fan and it seemed to block out most of the noise if there was someone staying beside me. Overall I would stay here again if I am ever in the area!"

Just bring some food and settle in for a wonderful visit. The hosts were always available to assist in any needed concern and were very courteous to deal with. The location is in a wooded area and extremely quiet. This lends itself for a relaxing stay away from the normal hustle and bustle. The internet works well, however cell service from this location can be challenging at times. In all, we look forward to a return visit in the near future without hesitation."
