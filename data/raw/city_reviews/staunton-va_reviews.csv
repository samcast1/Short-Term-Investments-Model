Stayed a few nights","What a fabulous stay. First off, Staunton exceeded all expectations. It's incredibly charming with lots to see and do. Don't miss the performances at the Shakespeare theater in town. Secondly, you couldn't choose a more charming, peaceful, easy-to-use, comfortable, private place than Annie's. I spent hours out on the deck overlooking the forest, listening to and watching the birds (and deer!) and thinking - now THIS is a vacation. Thirdly, you couldn't ask for a better host. When we arrived, she'd obviously tried to think of EVERYTHING we might need to make us feel at home and made it available. She was quick to respond to questions and just so friendly. Simply put, it's the PERFECT AirBnB. Thank you so much, Annie."

Stayed one night","Wow! Our stay at the Sweet Darling House was absolutely delightful. From the moment we arrived, we felt right at home thanks to the warm welcome from our hosts. Each room is beautiful and cozy, with so much attention to detail. We loved having our morning coffee on the back deck, soaking in the sounds of birds chirping. The dreamy backyard was the perfect spot to relax and unwind! The bed was incredibly comfortable, and we slept great.
We enjoyed taking walks to downtown, admiring the beautiful architecture of Staunton along the way.
The check-in process was smooth and convenient, with excellent communication from our hosts throughout our stay. Sweet Darling House is our favorite Airbnb experience, and we cannot wait to return."

The place was clean/ had everything you could want in the kitchen etc. The location was great: you could walk all around downtown- very dog friendly and easy to get to Charlottesville . Consider this place if going to Staunton- you wont be disappointed.

Loved the stereo and record collection. Airy and spacious. Enjoyable to just hang out together. Clean, clean, clean!!
We love to walk and didn't move our car except for an afternoon jaunt to Lexington. Everything we wanted to do was walkable from the apartment.
Would highly recommend and would do it again if the opportunity presents!"

We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely return!
Our only nit was the over excessive communication from AirBnb plus the corporate app used for info (Operto). It's a bit clunky and gives a bad vibe that you're dealing with a company rather than local hosts."

The apartment itself was stocked with everything we needed for our unexpected week away from home. It was cute and comfortable, and I cannot think of a single ""area for improvement"" - like, 10/10. As for the hosts, they were very communicative and provided all of the information that we needed ahead of our visit.

Stayed a few nights","I was in town for a couple nights and this was the best deal around. Laurie's place was clean and comfortable and at night it was pretty quiet even though it's right near downtown. The full kitchen and French press with coffee was great to have. Lots of natural light throughout. Like others have mentioned, the WiFi speed could be pretty slow at times, I had some work to do there and that was the only issue I had. That's really not an issue at all though unless you gave to work. overall this was such a great place and you can walk just about anywhere you want. highly recommend!"

Stayed one night","The Great:
-Location, Location, Location! I parked my car when I arrived in Staunton and didn't move it again until I departed.
-Terrific value for dollar.
-Quite Cozy. Loved the lived-in look of the place. It felt like I was visiting/staying with a friend
-Learned to operate a coffee press! (Printed directions in binder where perfect.)
-Sleep machine was terrific extra.
The slightly less than great:
-Loft is on surprizingly noisy street for such an small, adorable town. I was forewarned by previous guests' write-ups, so I was not surprized. If you're lookin' for quiet...this place is not for you."

Although we really didn't need anything, Laurie responded immediately when we reached out. The building is the site of some Staunton history and Laurie thoughtfully provided a link that tells the story.
We look forward to staying in Laurie's apartment the next time we visit Staunton."

Stayed one night","Great location for accessing Downtown by foot. If you want to be in the center of things, this is one that delivers. Steep stairs with bike stored in hallway to navigate on way up to unit. Parking in front of building but it is a narrow, dark and busy street use caution. Great instructions by host. The art work and comfy sofa were highlights of the unit. Compared to other places we've stayed in Staunton it is a bit tired (cracked blinds, water stained tabletops, dated bathroom, minimalist kitchen) but price reflects that somewhat. There was dishsoap but no other cleaning supplies or wipes available for routine cleanups. Seems host was making some updates from ""grad student loft"" decor. Good price, great location, secure building."

Stayed a few nights",Laurie was super responsive and helpful. The place was great. Couch is comfy. The coffee is delicious. So def take advantage of that. I would say the wifi was slower than I expected and after 9p it was really hard to connect to at times. The black out windows in bedroom was great but there is none in living room so if you’re sensitive to light bring an eye mask. When I have to come back this will be on my top places to look at first. Thanks again.

Good a/c, fast internet. Apartment was especially clean and had many nice touches such as a selection of teas and extra towels available.
Parking was available outside the door during most of our stay, but if not, there is a large parking garage less than a block away. It was easy to unload our stuff then put our car in the garage.
If we come back, I hope we will be able to stay there again.

Stayed a few nights","The Lewis Creek Loft was perfect for our first foray into AirBnB. The Loft’s location was easy walking distance to the historical downtown Staunton and a variety of restaurants. We were interested in glass blowing which was perfect because Sunspots Studio was 400 feet from the Loft. We enjoy the arts and history. Staunton has both. In addition to glass blowing we toured Blackfriars theater and sat in on a rehearsal for a concert at Trinity Church, also just 400 feet from the Loft. Also a short distance is the historic railroad depot which is an Amtrak station and the starting point for the Virginia Scenic Railroad. We didn’t get to go on the train ride, but hope maybe the next time.
Laurie was the perfect host, her instructions were clear and she responded quickly to a number of questions. All in all we would definitely recommend Lewis Creek Loft to anyone."

Stayed about a week","We stayed at Laurie’s place for 10 days in July. The location can’t be beat and the price is great. Laurie is quick to respond and provides detailed instructions. There are a couple of things that should be mentioned however. Keep in mind that these things wouldn’t necessarily have been issues for a shorter stay.
First, and I know this sounds odd: the toilet is tiny—like a child-size toilet. We are both tall (6’ 4” and 6’), and it was an an adventure getting onto and off of it. I’ve never encountered a toilet so small anywhere other than in an elementary school.
Second, the bed and the couch are uncomfortable. It was difficult to rest and relax after about the third day.
Third, the mini-split a/c unit is adequate for the living area and kitchen, but not the bedroom. This did not help with the sleeping situation. To be fair, there is a fan and that helped.
Staunton is a great place and Laurie is a great host and we enjoyed our stay in spite of the negatives."

Stayed a few nights","Great weekend! The apartment is accurately described and pictured in the listing, and check-in instructions were clear. My husband and I found this to be a great, cozy landing space for a weekend of fun in the area. Other than a tour at Polyface Farms, we walked everywhere - you can see the Saturday morning Farmer's Market outside the kitchen window. It's across the street from the beautiful Trinity Church (est 1746!) where we enjoyed Sunday morning worship. And downtown Staunton is an easy stroll for eating, drinking, and window shopping. Since it's so close to downtown, you can hear traffic from the apartment - don't think of this as a rural retreat. The sounds weren't too intrusive for us, but fan and the kindly supplied ear plugs in the bedroom would also help if needed. This is a great value in a great location. We enjoyed a refreshing weekend, and would gladly return."

Stayed a few nights","We had an amazing stay at Laurie’s loft! It was a clean, unique, cozy place to stay as my wife and I explored Staunton for the first time. It’s within walking distance of a whole lot of restaurants, shops, breweries, etc. Perfect location, but just far enough away from the main streets to avoid any real commotion. We stayed over St. Patrick’s Day weekend, and while you could hear passing cars pretty well from the bedroom, we didn’t hear any noises or partying at all. Laurie was thorough and friendly in her communication, and we would love to come stay again.
The only negative, at least for us: the mattress was really, really firm. At home, we have a pretty soft bed that you can really sink into, so we did not sleep very well. However, that’s just our preference, so we didn’t feel it deserved to lower our overall rating as it really was a great place to stay in an awesome town. Aside from the bed, we loved everything about this place and downtown Staunton! Thank you, Laurie!"

This didn’t bother us at all, but might be something to consider if you need quiet . There is no free 24 hour parking, however we had no trouble getting a space in front of the building, which is free but with a two hour limit M-F, 9-5.

There are so many activities and restaurants just outside the door, and even a farmer's market on Saturday mornings. Our visit was in late summer, but I am sure that the town is even lovelier when the leaves start to change. The building itself has an interesting story, and adds to the charm.

There's a brew pub, a winery, a cidery, and a bistro with patio dining all less than a block away. Arts venues, the farmers' market, and main street shops are close as well. The apartment is unusual in giving the feeling that the owner had actually lived there and knew how to make it comfortable, with bedside reading lamps, a lap rug, and a very comfortable couch, as well as attractive, with its Paris-themed art. It was not noisy, despite the central location, and because the city wasn't busy, we found free parking on the street right outside most days and all nights during our nine-day stay. We would definitely return!"

We were able to go up a street or so after 3 pm and there is no charge for parking after 5 pm so that was perfect. We usually came in around 3 pm and left again around 7 pm for meetings, so it worked out perfect. On the weekend, the Farmers Market is located directly behind the Loft, which was a good deal. Definitely would definitely recommend and hopefully it will be available next year on our annual trip to Staunton, VA."

You can't beat the location: Laurie's place is within easy walking distance of everything in the historic Staunton downtown area, including restaurants, shops, the Shakespeare theater, and the Amtrak station. The apartment itself feels like an artist's loft. It's cozy, clean, and very pleasant to stay in. My friends and I were quite comfortable sleeping one to the bed, the air mattress Laurie provided, and the sofa. Laurie also went out of her way to get us some information on local restaurants and transportation, which we really appreciated! We would be happy to stay here again."

The loft was so clean and homey, it felt as though I was coming home from a long trip rather than arriving at an unknown apartment for my vacation.
Laurie provided incredibly clear directions for check in and how to access the unit. It felt safe and secure, a wonderful getawat. Could not recommend this place more!!! Next time I need an Air BnB in Staunton, this will be the first unit I look for."

Stayed a few nights","The Loft was fanTASTic! Like all of the other reviews say, location was excellent. Hostess Laurie was off the charts.
Staunton has some nuanced public parking arrangements, but it is really very simple, and Laurie's explanation makes it very clear.
Laurie happens to be the proprietor of Newtown Bakery. Newtown Bakery (bread, sweets, pasta, pizza,etc) should be on your list of places to stop for breakfast or dinner. It was a big hit with our crowd, locally and organically sourced, priced reasonably, and without any pretentiousness.
I had personal distractions up until the time we left, so I ended up hitting Laurie with a dozen questions abiut Staunton logistics at the last minute just before our trip. Her grace, patience and results-oriented responses were more than I could have or should have expected.
Thank you for virtually holding my hand, Laurie! You typify the best of AirBnB!"

Best Airbnb experience I have ever had. My husband and I just wanted to stay in the space as much as possible to enjoy the atmosphere!

Stayed a few nights","It was a great distance from everything. Everything was walkable.
Just be mindful of the other people in the building, as conversations can be heard through the doors since it's an older building with gaps in the doors.
The spiral staircase was a challenge, but we got used to it after the 1st day. There is a bigger staircase in the back that will take you to the 2nd floor directly into the bedroom, but we couldn't get it open.
The little kitchen was adorable and we loved the provided kcups!
The tv has access to different streaming platforms if you have your own & sign into it.
The free laundry room was very convenient and appreciated.
Cute place!

Stayed a few nights","This cute little place has cute decor and a fantastix location. Truly just parked there and walked around the historic downtown area. It is close to several restaurants, including the Shack which was incredible. The airbnb was as described and clean; check in was easy. The bathroom sink was really nicely redone. The hosts were communicative and helpful with suggestions. The only thing I would offer as a helpful tip to others is that the windows are old and don’t filter out the car noise. There is a white noise machine but just a flag for those who prefer earbuds instead. So if I stay there again I will bring earbuds. The mattress was firm and comfy overall great stay can’t complain."

Loads of Street Parking right in front of the house. The spiral staircase felt very safe (I'm in my late 50's) plus there is an alternate set of conventional stairs accessible in the hallway. The artwork is fun and adds a nice touch to the interior design!!! The Couch was cozy for watching movies on a big TV!
I'll definitely stay here again!!"

Stayed one night","Jeremy’s place was an absolutely wonderful stay! Though we were only there for 1 night, it definitely left an impression due to the extreme cleanliness, thoughtful layout, cozy atmosphere, and great location.
It has a nice, relaxing, and genuinely comfortable couch/living room/TV area and we LOVED that both the bedroom AND bathroom were upstairs so we didn’t have to traverse down in the middle of the night — that’s rare for the loft-style and was much appreciated. The bed is also SO comfy, but bring a sleep mask if you’re light-sensitive (the streetlights bleed in). We also loved the thoughtful touches to make our night easier, like a white noise machine, ceiling fan, and easy charger plug ins for both sides of the bed.
The location was easy to find and is very walkable to numerous quaint locations around Staunton and would be a great central location for any newcomer. We would recommend this place to anyone and would love to stay here again!"

It's at the top of a short hill which I enjoyed walking back up in the morning with a breakfast drink from Cranberries. The bed was super comfy and had everything a person would need for a good nights sleep. It is located on a Main Street leading into downtown, so there's a good amount of traffic, but I wasn't disturbed by this at all and found the apartment to be quiet inside (Im sensitive to noise, so this says a lot). Perfectly located to explore Staunton, the mountains and many other day trips. Street parking in front of the building was always available.Definitely a great place!"

Stayed about a week","My wife and I stayed at Jeremy's for a week and it was wonderful! The town of Staunton is a real walkable gem. Jeremy's place is just a few minutes walk from loads of restaurants, shops, breweries, coffee houses and wine bars - we enjoyed them all! The place itself is very, very nice. Comfortable bed, a cute living room, kitchen and coffee maker, big tv with streaming options, on site laundry, parking and more. The place is historic but feels very modern and clean. We are cyclists and spent a lot of time on the local gravel roads which are incredible! We will definitely be back to Staunton and to Jeremy's home. Thanks Jeremy!"

Stayed a few nights","Staunton is such a great town with so many options for dining and entertainment. This unit is just a 4 minute walk into town. The TV had lots of apps for watching our shows during our stay (Netflix, Hulu, Prime, etc). Plus, the bed was super comfy. We loved all of the different settings, lounge mode was our favorite for laying in bed while catching up on emails and reading. I’m rating 4 stars because a few things would have made our experience better- a full length mirror, and better coffee :) luckily Staunton has great local coffee, but we would’ve appreciated having a solid cup of coffee in the unit before heading into town. We still had a great time and would stay here again!"

Great location, central to everything, clean, comfortable. Loved having a living room/kitchen and watching Netflix on the TV downstairs before going upstairs to the sleeping area. The bed was quite comfortable (bonus, it's a posturpedic so you can raise up in the morning while you drink coffee:). It's a block from The Shack, which was maybe the best dinner I've had in VA. Jeremy was so easy to communicate with and obviously understands hospitality. Thank you to Jeremy and Desiree, we will 100% be back!"

The bed linens were high quality and very comfortable. The body wash, shampoo, conditioner, dish soap, and hand soap provided were all high quality and mostly organic products. There are several options for coffee: Keurig (with several pods of coffee, tea, and hot chocolate provided), drip coffee, and French press! There’s even a coffee grinder! Bring your beans! Jeremy has really thought of all you could need! We had a few questions and Jeremy was very helpful and extremely prompt and professional with communication. Lastly, the place is close to everything downtown. We had an easy walk to all the shops and restaurants including the Woodrow Wilson Museum and house and the Shakespeare theater. Highly Recommended!

We were there for a longer stay - a week - so the laundry room was super appreciated. We were also able to make the kitchen work for us. Street parking was also super easy - there was always a space available for us. We didn't spend too much time with Jeremy, but when we did meet he was incredibly friendly and super quick/responsive via text. He was clearly available if we had needed anything. PS. The bed was awesome."

Stayed a few nights","My dog and I enjoyed our stay in Staunton. The Traveler's Nook is small, but was the perfect size for the two of us. If you intend to walk around, be advised the area is hilly and steep. Going downtown takes about 14 minutes, but the return walk is almost entirely uphill. The neighborhood is quiet, but the building is split into multiple units. While I didn't have neighbor noise, I could hear every squeak of the floorboards as well as the vacuum when cleaning was occurring. That didn't disturb us, except the floorboards in the Nook are squeaky and I was concerned every noise I made carried into other units. The space was well kempt and comfortable. My only complaint is about the kitchenette. It was well stocked and had what I needed, but the faucet is extremely shallow. Any time I wanted to wash dishes or use the sink, I had to hunch down underneath the oven hood, which was uncomfortable. All in all, I got what I needed for my brief writer's retreat and would stay again."

Stayed with a pet","This apartment suited us perfectly for our introduction to Staunton. The space provided privacy when needed for us and dog friendly for our short haired dachshund. The fenced in backyard and close proximity to the grassy fields of Mary Baldwin served us well.
We appreciated the artwork as well as terrific location. Downtown and the wharf district were easy walks. We ate great food at 4 different restaurants. We rode the steam engine and saw a very well acted play, “Once,” performed by the ShenanArts group."

It’s great for anyone with dogs with lots of places to walk both in town and on the grounds of the college at the top of the hill. There is a small backyard for the dogs to go as well. Christi was super responsive and helpful. Highly recommend if you want a cute, low-key place to chill while in Staunton. Would stay again."

Stayed a few nights","The space is exactly as described and was a good fit for our needs.
Pros: Christi allowed us to check in 2 hours early and we were very appreciative. I had asked the day before about early check in, but did not get a response. I followed up the next day and was told we could check in early. We appreciated that. Also, it was easy to check in.
Cons: The dogs upstairs barked for almost 2 hours, but we didn’t let the hosts know in hopes they would return and the barking would stop. Once we reached out, she apologized and immediately sent someone to take care of them.
Ultimately, we decided to cut our stay short. We did let her know as soon as we checked out. There was no response for several hours, which was fine that time as we didn’t need anything."

Stayed with a pet","We stayed here on the last night of a 12-day road trip from NJ to New Orleans with our pup, Samson, and it was perfect for our needs! We got in later than expected and frazzled from a long drive, but the entry was simple, the back porch was a great spot to sit and enjoy the fresh air, and the little living room gave us a chance to decompress before heading to bed. Speaking of which, the bed was super comfortable, and I loved the USB outlets in the headboard!!
In the morning the pups upstairs and next door were a bit excited about Samson’s presence, so he and I enjoyed a short walk to the Mary Baldwin College campus, with great views of the mountains outside town. Overall it was a welcome respite from a long drive, and I would definitely stay again the next time we are traveling on I-81."

The home has so many personal touches like descriptions where all of the pottery and artwork are from. I feel like I am visiting a friend. Our dog was welcome and had space to run in a fenced back yard. We walked with our dog downtown to eat with the Main Street blocked off for walking traffic. I would highly recommend this home!

The neighborhood is nice and quiet and it was easy to find a spot on the street to park. The host provides lots of information about the area and suggestions of things to do/see/eat. Considering you are staying in a basement apartment in an old house, you do hear lots of noise (foot steps, dog barking) from upstairs. The backyard is fenced in which was nice for our 2 dogs, however, there was lots of poop so watch your step! Overal, a good deal."

The location is absolutely lovely; right next to a gorgeous college campus and a short walk down the hill into the cute town. One particularly cool thing about this place was the collection of old VHS movies with a working VHS player! It was great fun indulging some nostalgia with an old VHS copy of Aladdin. We would happily stay again when we are in Staunton.

Stayed a few nights","A lovely home and a great space. The bed was SO COMFORTABLE, I could find what I needed, and You will find your hosts are welcoming and helpful without a hint of “too much”. It was just the rest I needed after a tough trip. Staunton is a lovely town, everyone is friendly, from shopkeepers to the restaurant chefs, too the people you meet along the way. Zynodoa is an amazing farm to table experience. I tried the tasting menu and the wines were curated perfectly with the dishes presented…I ordered a “to go” cornbread to bring home to family. I spent an afternoon reading and swimming at one of the lovely parks in town. Visited Polyface Farm…gorgeous working farm with the best sustainably raised pastured pork, chickens, grass fed beef, rabbit and eggs. An educational experience…if you’re interested in how your food should be grown, you should at least look up some videos from Polyface. I love listening to and reading most of Joel Salatin’s books. All and all a wonderful stay at the perfect location."

Really helped take the guesswork out of things that can be more time consuming to figure out at other Airbnb’s. I appreciated the little touches like having shampoo/conditioner/body soap because I always forget to bring on trips. And the location was pretty great being in in a neighborhood, yet next to Mary Baldwin’s beautiful campus with views of the town below, and within walking distance to downtown for meals and shopping. There were some initial family noises like barking dogs and piano practice from above, but it was all quiet and calm by the time I returned from dinner. Just makes it feel more like home!"

Stayed a few nights","We can’t say enough good things about our stay! The 10 acre family farm was lovely; we loved all of the animals and beautiful scenery. The cottage was quiet and comfortable. Jeremy greeted us upon arrival and provided additional information on the property, things to do, places to eat, etc… We were out and about the majority of the weekend we were at the cottage, but enjoyed chatting with Katie and Jeremy when we ran across them on the property. Historic Staunton is awesome and walkable. Local coffee, local hard cider, tons of antique shops, and a seriously fantastic burger place downtown. Seriously a jewel of a place! Definitely on our short list of places to revisit."

A very clean place with a full kitchen, a nice walking shower, and a comfortable bed with an extra sofa. Thank you, Katie & and Jeremy, for sharing your place with us! Tony & Alex 🙂"

Stayed a few nights","Our first visit to Staunton, & we can't imagine a better location for exploring the wonderful downtown area! This property is right in the heart of it all, with so many restaurants, breweries & shops within walking distance. We parked our car on Wed., & didn't move it until we left on Sun. (We were able to park on the quiet 1-way street in front of the property, but the parking garage is right across the street.)
The space is comfortable, & very clean. The downstairs has a sofa, tv, bar area, desk, & (pleasant surprise!) a half bath. The full bath, kitchen and bedroom are upstairs.
Hosts were super responsive & accommodating. I'd highly recommend!
[Other recommendations: Ciders from Mars-we sampled & enjoyed everything; Byers St. Bistro-excellent crab dip, prime beef sandwich, Happy Hippy pizza (sub sausage for artichoke), & strong/reasonably priced drinks; Shenandoah Pizza-pizza by the slice, meatball sub; Ubon-tasty Thai in a quirky setting, & the owner Ubon is a hoot!]"

It was RIGHT in the middle of downtown in a perfect location to access restaurants and awesome shopping. Super short walk from the train station too, if you travel with Amtrak. The unit itself is one of my favorite AirBnBs ever. It was so welcoming and intriguing! Lots of great natural light upstairs, and an awesome little kitchenette (with the coolest dang mini German oven/range/hood combo from the 70s). I would recommend to a friend in a heartbeat (already have, actually!) and 100% plan to return if I find myself in the area again. Truly a treat!"

Stayed a few nights","This was an absolutely lovely place to stay! So unique. It's very special to have a whole storefront to yourself--the bar downstairs was great fun, and the bedroom was beautiful and full of light. We stayed midweek and didn't hear much noise from the streets, and they had a white noise maker just in case. Perfect location for visiting Blackfriars Playhouse -- it was just a very short walk away. We also walked to a delicious quiche breakfast at the Pampered Palate around the corner and a tasty dinner at Zynodoa. Checkin/checkout was simple, and the parking garage (that they provide a pass for) is literally right across the street. Highly recommend.
(Note: if you're hoping to sleep in late and are light sensitive, the upstairs has a LOT of windows. There are blinds and curtains, but the curtains are a bit thin so it was quite bright by 7:30am in the summer. All the light is beautiful but just something to note.)"

Stayed a few nights","What a wonderful place to stay. As great as the pictures make it look. But hands-down the best thing is the location. So great to be able to stop back at your place and drop off what you just bought. So great to have 12-second walk to the best croissants outside of France (Reunion Bakery). So great to be a block away from Beverly street which they close on the weekends and make a pedestrian thoroughfare and all the restaurants spill out into the street. Oh, wait, am I writing a review for Staunton or this place? Staunton is a fantastic place to walk around and enjoy the architecture, shops, restaurants, art galleries, and coffee shops, but getting to stay right in the very middle of it all makes this place ideal (so long as you are good with going up and down stairs since your bedroom is on the second floor.) Wait, actually, don't tell anyone, I want it to be available next time we come :-)"

Stayed a few nights","This “very small hotel” is charming in so many ways and is wonderfully furnished for a couple such as us. It contained everything we needed for an enjoyable stay. Jamie was an outstanding host whose good taste and understanding of visitors’ practical needs were reflected throughout the unit. She provided helpful information before and after our arrival and responded quickly whenever we had questions. She was exceptionally helpful in arranging for anniversary flowers waiting for my wife when we arrived.
The location of this AirB&B was perfect for exploring Staunton’s shopping, dining, cultural and entertainment opportunities which are all within easy walking distance. And the parking garage is just across the street.
We have stayed at many AirB&B locations in Europe and the U.S. over the last 5 years. This was one of the very best experiences we’ve had with AirB&B thanks to its location, design, and, especially, its host, Jamie. We highly recommend it to others planning a stay in Staunton."

Stayed one night","The Storefront was such a unique stay! We loved the space. It was nice having two whole floors to ourselves with the skylights upstairs and the huge window downstairs seeing the people walk by. The bar area was really cool. Everything you need for coffee in the morning is provided. It's right in the middle of where all the shops and restaurants are so you don't need the car once you park it. The parking is convenient with the parking garage right across the street. We didn't even need the parking pass provided as it seems on weekends the parking garage was free. The only downside of the stay was dealing with the clicking sound in the ceiling upstairs. If you are a light sleeper, this may be an issue. However, once we determined it had to do with the HVAC ductwork, we turned the heat down low and just used the fireplace and space heater downstairs. It kept the downstairs nice and warm. Upstairs was much warmer than downstairs so having the heat turned down low wasn't an issue there."

We loved the convenience of the location, and the people watching from our own living room (the living room is essentially a storefront in DT Staunton). The kitchen (upstairs) is very nice and well supplied. We were able to cook full meals easily, when we didn't feel like walking a couple of blocks to some great restaurants and bars. The half-bath on the first floor is a great convenience. One of Staunton's public parking decks is directly across the street from the unit, and a parking pass comes with the rental. Couldn't be easier.
Jamie and the rest of the team is VERY responsive and accommodating. We had a wonderful time and would be excited to return soon."

We also had a short walk to dinner and enjoyed walking the blocks around the area marveling at the architecture. It would be a great town for a movie set. The bed was comfortable and the fridge upstairs in the kitchen has a full fridge so we were able to freeze our cooler ice blocks. Just a tip, push hard on the door in warmer weather to open it after entering your code. I thought the lock wasn't working but it was just the door sticking. Nice and clean!"

Stayed a few nights","Wow - what an excellent stay in Staunton, Virginia.
For starters, you'd be hard pressed to find an affordable place to stay with such an amazing location. Staying here, you are blocks away from being in the heart of a downtown that features incredible restaurants and a diverse selection of storefronts. The location alone is worth the stay.
Next, what an incredibly unique interior that is cozy enough for 1-2, but makes you want to host for 7-8 people. The bar area downstairs was equally stylish and polarizing. I found myself wanting to stand behind the bar with a towel on my shoulder serving my parents and telling stories. An incredibly cool touch.
The Storefront was incredibly clean and stylishly decorated. The skylights leading upstairs give off incredible light as well. Having two bathrooms is a definite perk. Communication with the hosts was fast, informative, and easy.
Would absolutely recommend staying here to anyone, and I say that with a bit of caution as I do not want to give away a hidden gem."

The unit was everything I thought it would be and more. The decorations were colorful, happy and beautifully arranged. The master bedroom was truly romantic and spoke to my inner “Hippy”!
We were also blown away by the historic village with its great shops and restaurants… not to mention the amazing architecture of all the neighborhood homes.
We will definitely be back, making Staunton, VA a regular stop on our annual East Coast Road Trip!"

Stayed one night","This is our 4th year visiting Staunton - this was by far the best stay we have had. The apartment was spotless. Very cozy. The décor was very nice. I really can't overstate how clean the apartment was.
They provided everything you would need. Small snacks, coffee, toiletries, and makeup remover wipes.
The location is perfect. Just a short stroll to the main part of downtown to the stores, restaurants, and train station .
I liked that they had a smart tv so we could log into all our favorite streaming channels. Also very cool that the tv is on a moveable stand so it's away most of the time. Encourages cozy reading - instead of tv time.
We alerted the host to a minor maintenance issue (not something we needed fixed during our stay), they responded right away and were very kind and responsive.
We will definitely be back and we are looking forward to staying at other locations offered by the same host."

Stayed over a week","I've fallen in love with Staunton, & my time in this house is one big reason why. When the description says ""steps from"" awesome Blackfriars Playhouse & the cute downtown, they mean it -- like 2 minutes around the corner (& equally close in the other direction from the excellent restaurant The Shack). The decor is exactly as pictured, which might be over the top for some people, but it fed my soul & I turned on those twinkle lights every single evening. The little kitchen worked well for this solo traveler to cook up some farm-fresh meals. Thanks to the provided guide to area things to do, I tried two amazing hikes that were new to me despite having visited Shenandoah many times as a kid. (Crabtree Falls, my goodness, go see it!) This apartment even has a nice deep bathtub that was great for soaking my post-hike muscles.
If the Bohemian Suite is unavailable next time I'm craving a Shenandoah Valley fix, I'll (pout but) look into another one in the same house. Loved staying here."

Stayed with kids","You can't beat the location — right around the corner from the busy streets and slightly out of the way, but easily accessible to everything. The decoration is a little intense, but the apartment is overall quite comfortable.
A couple of things to be aware of: the apartment door doesn't have an inside lock or bolt beyond the one opened with the keypad. There is no dining table, so this is probably not the place to do a lot of cooking/eating (but with all the restaurants downtown, probably not a huge issue). And finally, there's a lot of Christian symbolism in the decoration (crosses, etc.), so if you're not comfortable being surrounded by that, probably better to find another spot."

The colorful decor was rejuvinating and just enjoyable to be surrounded by. The host was super responsive and friendly. Perfect place!

There was plenty of hot water an pressure in the shower. The Victorian style house in which the apartment is located is surrounded by other houses with similarly unique and beautiful period architecture, We were only there for one night so we didn't get a chance to use the kitchen, but it seemed well equipped. Not that you will want to cook much, with all the eat out or carry-in options in town. Check-in was easy and Michaela was a perfect host. We will be back!"

We stayed at this AirBnB for two and a half weeks during a busy time of year and needed to make our reservations a few days at a time. As a result we had to change apartments three times. Each time she accommodated our special needs for flexibility. All in all we were impressed and will not hesitate to return."

Stayed a few nights","The Bohemian Suite in Staunton is just wonderful. My wife and I visited for a few days and really enjoyed our time. The place is well cared for and very conveniently located. The charm of Staunton is amplified by this laid back and well-designed Victorian home. As with any home it has quirks. This is an older home with creaky floors and not perfectly aligned doors but, the owners have done a fabulous job of updating and decorating these suites. During our stay we had everything we could need to make us feel at home. You can feel confident that should any issues arise during your stay you will have all the support you need, in a caring and helpful manner. I highly recommend that you give the Bohemian Suite a stay. We did and will again."

Stayed a few nights","The Bohemian Suite is definitely unique in style! Every little detail was creatively inspired for a comfortable and cozy set up and atmosphere.
Location is excellent!! Within walking distance to the historic district/downtown; very convenient and we didn’t have to worry much about parking.
The rooms are segregated and well equipped with all the necessary amenities for a short stay. The TV with streaming service is a nice and convenient addition!
The only negative point for us is that the cleaning fee is inconsistent once you see the checkout process with a few cleaning requests for guests to do in preparation for the cleaning crew. We always do our best to leave the spaces in order upon our departure, facilitating the work for hosts, but a considerably high cleaning fee with additional requests on the way out doesn’t really make sense to us and, in the end, the checkout process isn’t as smooth as it should be, especially when you’re on vacation and trying to have a relaxing time.
Other than that, the stay was delightful and we truly appreciate all the extra touches!"

I think I was the only one in the building during my stay but this is a historic building with four units that all appear to be short term rentals. Was an amazing place to relax as a solo adult on a work trip but I probably would feel nervous about bringing my very young children who would be a little *too* interested in all of the various fun decor.

Stayed a few nights","I have stayed in 3 different properties in Staunton over the years and Staunton Stays was by far the best. The suite was comparable to a 1-bedroom apartment in size with large, whimsically decorated rooms (I was in the Boho Suite). The bed was very comfortable, and I loved lounging in the window seat or reading on the front porch. The suite was equipped with many of the small details that I often find missing in other accommodations. For instance, there was a nightlight in the bathroom, a space to put my toiletries bag, and 2 hooks for towels. I don't cook, but if I did, the kitchen seemed well-equipped. Cleverly, the TV was on a wheeled stand, so you could watch it in either room, but it was not obtrusive if you preferred to read. The property was very quiet, and the locks worked just as described. Michaela is very responsive. It is ideally located close to both Beverley Street and the Wharf area. I will definitely stay here again, and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a place in Staunton."

Stayed a few nights","The Bohemian Suite is the perfect place for a short stay in Staunton. The quirky, eclectic, and interesting decor made it a unique place to stay, but the truly great thing about it was the location. It’s no more than a few minutes walk from anywhere you might want to go. Our suite was quiet, comfortable, and reasonably clean, given the number of “tchotchkes” there. The welcome bottle of wine awaiting our arrival was a very nice touch.
The only negatives, and they were not serious ones, were: (1) There is no real table to sit at if you want to eat in. There are snack tables, though. That said, the absence of a real table is clearly revealed in the photos of the Bohemian Suite on Airbnb, so no surprises there. (2) We would have liked to have a bar of shower soap rather than the little bottle of shower gel that was barely enough for two people, two nights.
Finally, a suggestion. Since the Bohemian Suite is a place of public accommodation in which no one regularly resides, the two small crucifixes (one atop the refrigerator and the other in the bathroom) could be off-putting to guests not of the Christian faith.
All in all, we would certainly try to book the Bohemian Suite for our next stay in Staunton and we would highly recommend it to anyone looking for short-term accommodations there."

The Bohemian suite was even nicer than the photos...with the high ceilings giving it a more spacious feel than what I had imagined. The listing is for a queen bed but it was actually a King size which was a nice surprise. The bed was comfortable and I loved all the fun decor. I never saw the host in person but had a fairly quick response time when I asked a question about local eateries. It also is so nice to get the extra touches such as a bottle of wine and a few small snacks left out for us. If I'm ever in Staunton again I would absolutely book this suite if it is available!

We loved chilling on the front porch with wine or coffee, or sleeping in in the comfy bed. But there's tons to do in Staunton and the suite is steps away from the Shakespeare theater and a cute coffee shop, as well as easily walkable to just about everywhere else. All the amenities one could want are there: K-cups, dishes for cooking, and even a clean, spacious laundry room, which was helpful because we stayed for a week. There's a great ""manual"" with suggestions for restaurants and even hiking trails (which we took advantage of) and it's clear the owners adore Staunton, and they want to share all this lovely town has to offer. Definitely book here!"

Stayed a few nights","One of the best Airbnbs we’ve ever stayed in! The suite was cozy and colorfully decorated. Lots of space and felt like a home away from home. Downtown Staunton is a cute mountain town and just a three minute walk away. While Staunton may not be a three day visit on its own on a random weekend in the winter, it was a perfect home base to see Natural Bridge, caverns, hiking the blue ridge tunnel, snow tubing at a resort, visiting Charlottesville, and a winery. You can make an unforgettable weekend here. The Staunton restaurants are great bookend to every day too. And during bad weather, this suite was an ideal place to curl up with a book, watch a movie, or just relax. Highly recommend."

The rooms are large and comfortable, full of interesting objects, colors and textures to rest your eyes on, and in our case, entertain a toddler. There was enough space that half of us could work in one room while the others slept. Fast WiFi, nice bath soaps in the bathroom. Michaela is also good about providing coffee, granola bars, and even a bottle of wine when you arrive. The apartment is a short walk to lots of other delicious food and drink. I love unwinding in Staunton, and the Bohemian Suite is a great place to do it!"

Stayed one night","We thoroughly enjoyed our quick overnight stay at Katie’s place! The space itself is very clean, quiet, safe, really nicely decorated, and spacious. It has a nice porch and also a couple of chairs in the lawn where you can sit and observe the wide variety of farm animals. The really great thing about Katie’s is that in addition to watching the animals from afar, you can also see them up close, just on the other side of a fence. They are all friendly and some will let you pet them or scratch their chins (we were fortunate to chat with Katie when we arrived and she let us know that this was an okay thing to do). There were also friendly cats and dogs and chickens that welcomed attention! The location is quite convenient to I-81 and the downtown of Staunton is just a few minutes drive away; there you can find plenty to see and do. A stay in a clean, quiet place with plenty of animal friends is my ideal stop - I wouldn’t hesitate to stay at Katie’s place again!"

I appreciated the hair dryer and dishes! The mattress was awesome and firm, we slept great. We loved getting woken up by the cute farm animals in the morning, it was a very unique experience.

Stayed with kids","Jeremy, the co-host we believe, was extremely rude at checkin. My wife and I were planning on staying at their Airbnb over the holidays to visit family. We had picked up a family member to help us carry in our things because we had our newborn infant and could use some extra hands. Jeremy did not even give a greeting before he very rudely asked how many people were staying. He then proceeded to seem surprised or upset that we had our infant despite our reservation clearly saying we would have our infant. Jeremy then seemed to be upset that we showed up at 4:15 despite the checkin time being between 3-10 PM. Furthermore, we noticed that Jeremy was watching us out of his window that faces the parking when we were returning from being with my family one night. Overall, Jeremy was not a friendly host at all and not welcoming. Unfortunately, Katie was much more polite but we only saw her once. We were very disappointed with our stay, especially since it was over the holiday."

Stayed one night","Adorable modernized 1900s studio “spring house” on “working farm”. (Read ‘space description’ and ‘house rules’)
Close to I-81; watch for inclined left driveway. Private; exact as pictured. Arrived late aft; host Jeremy warmly greeted us, along with free-roaming chickens and one of their friendly cats. Jeremy reviewed and expounded on rules and property. Suggested restaurant “Gloria’s Pupuseria” for dinner, of which we went and it was fab!
Other pros: Comfy bed, nice linens/towels, great/hot shower, pet all their farm animals but one, field with a vista—even a cave, to view. Historic lovely downtown; rolling hills surround.
Cons: House rules state “working farm”—loved, that! But, not seeing their chickens allowed to roam their AB&B business guest’s parking and space entrance areas. Pray hosts have attended to this as you read this!Coffee/sugar; but no creamer, or tea. Dead bugs in bathroom light/fan fixture. No ceiling/wall fan in living/bed area."

Stayed one night","Katie and Jeremy's Firefly Springhouse was charming. It was in a beautiful country setting. When we arrived, Jeremy met us and gave us a brief tour of the cute farm, including some welcoming hens, several Guiney hens, ducks, fainting goats, and a very friendly pig. Although the springhouse is part of a farm, it is very close and convenient to the town.
The bed was very comfortable, there were snacks, and a nice selection of coffee and tea.
We would certainly stay there again if we were in the area!"

Stayed about a week","Staying at the Firefly Springhouse was such a great escape from reality for a week. Katie and Jeremy were such gracious hosts and absolutely amazing with local recommendations on where to eat and what to do during our stay. The location was fantasic, serene, and so peaceful. My girlfriend and I loved waking up or coming back to the Springhouse after a long day and just watching the animals interact. When we would head out for the day, we would turn off the AC, and the Springhouse would stay cool all throughout the day until we came back. It was such a cozy little place and an amazing experience to be there. I highly recommend staying here to enjoy what Staunton has to offer and for a nice stay away from the hustle and bustle of town."

Katie greeted us upon arrival, gave us some restaurant recommendations (the one we chose was great), and introduced us to her friendly animals! When we had an issue with the TV, she came over immediately and fixed the problem. The property was easy to access from the highway, but VERY quiet and safe. We would definitely stay there again if our travels bring us to the area."

The cottage’s proximity to downtown Staunton and the nearby festival we were attending made this the perfect respite and landing spot for our weekend. I knew from the moment our host introduced us to the farm cats that it was going to be a welcoming place. The bed was very comfortable, the accommodations were clean and cozy, and the hosts were accessible. It was fun being warbled at by a confusion of fretting Guinea hens…and to our credit, we opted against startling the fainting goats. Would definitely return if we need an overnight near Staunton."

Stayed one night","Clearly marked parking in the driveway...and once we walked over to the cabin, we were able to see the gorgeous surroundings. Easy to use code to open the door and there was great layout inside. The bed was super comfy for two people with the all-important fuzzy blanket and fluffy pillows. Hook to hang coat, place to put wet boots, well-appointed kitchen nook, and clean updated bathroom. We felt so relaxed at Katie's cabin and were blessed with listening to a rain storm (great sounds from the roof!). Also easy to use WiFi and nice television. Really, the ""Firefly Springhouse"" is worthy to be a destination in itself. If you are an animal lover, there are opportunities to see chickens, kitties, pigs and all sort of photo opportunities as well. This is beyond the best AirBnB we've ever stayed in and the real reason an AirBnB can be superior over any other traditional accommodation. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."

Looking for a place to escape the rain after a camping trip, we booked Katie's place just as a crash pad. She accepted our reservation quickly, gave clear instructions, and the room and bathroom were clean, cute, and comfortable. Waking up in the morning to the farm animals (goats, pigs, chickens, ducks, silly cats) and a dewy morning made me want to stay there at the little farm forever. Katie was around to answer questions about the animals, give dining recommendations, and she has very smart and responsible children who help care for the animals.
Anyways, it was beautiful, with fantastic food options in town, and I would give more than 5 stars if I could. THANKS KATIE!"

The surroundings are absolutely gorgeous, with views of rolling hills in the distance and several unique and magical features built in the early 1900s. We were lucky to be greeted by Katie and one of her daughters who introduced us to their friendly animals. The springhouse, where we slept, is very comfortable and well equipped. We enjoyed an evening stroll around the property petting the animals, followed by a rest in the hammock and outdoor chairs. Mid-week shopping and dining in Staunton was surprisingly fun, and we plan to return with our bikes soon. When we return, we will absolutely book another stay at Katie and Jeremy's family farm.

The host met me outside and gave me the property history, which was fascinating if you like history. It is such a cute little space and was warm and cozy. Just what I needed on my pass through town."

Stayed a few nights",This little farm is a hidden gem in the Staunton area. The hosts were absolutely awesome - from their communication to the tour of their beautiful little farm. They even let us hold baby goats! Unreal. Now the area - felt so secluded but was only a short drive to downtown. Great restaurants and hiking all around. We will absolutely be back to stay with them in the spring. Thanks again!

Stayed one night","As soon as we were approved, Katie turned on a light and the heat for us and promptly gave us instructions and clear rules. The cottage was very cozy, comfortable, and had everything you could need to get by a couple nights (fridge, microwave, table, etc). the Keurig was a huge plus and a nice way to enjoy the morning sitting on the deck watching the farm animals. Very quiet and the owners caught up with us as we were leaving and were extremely friendly and helpful in giving us a lay of the land. Will definitely come back again soon enough!"
