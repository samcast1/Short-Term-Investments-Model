Stayed a few nights","Roberto was very friendly and the communication went well. Located in a quiet neighborhood and was well equipped (kitchen with fridge, stove, microwave, washer and dryer). Roberto kindly left water in the fridge for the guests. Unfortunately, the fire alarms were removed contrary to the description and partly it was not completely clean (dishes, floors (partly) not wiped). Otherwise a enjoyable stay."

We slept great in the comfortable bed. The couch and bar stools were also very comfortable. The neighborhood is very quiet and friendly.
I would not hesitate to recommend this rental to a friend. I hope it’s available for the next time we come to the Monterey Peninsula."

Stayed with a pet","Wow, who ever designed the unit has great taste. My bf and I were admiring the wall paint choice how it almost looked concrete, very very cool. How did you do it? Was it plaster? Sheetrock? Anyways it’s a great little unit looks brand new!
The neighborhood is okay, mostly families of working class which is where I feel most comfortable. If your dog likes to chase cats, beware entering and exiting the unit as well as walking the neighborhood because a lot of cats roam free.
Everyone I spoke to in the neighborhood was super friendly, and I loved this was a pet friendly unit. I couldn’t hear the main house residents and when I arrived (early) everything was setup and ready to go.
Good news is there is parking off street directly in front of the unit which made loading and unloading effortless. I noticed by nightfall the street parking is minimal. Being able to park in the driveway was clutch!
I would recommend this unit to anyone and everyone who is looking for a *brand new* rental"

Overall, the place looks like advertised, Roberto added nice, personal touches here and there which added to the welcoming feel of the apartment. However, it could have been cleaned a little more thoroughly, especially in the corners and the shower. Overall good if you’re looking for a quite place for a couple of nights."

Stayed one night","Stayed here in between a location switch for a gig I had in Gilroy & Carmel over Labor Day weekend. Wish I had more time to spend here (I was in late and out early) but enjoyed it when I was here! It’s in a part of Salinas that’s near a lot such as grocery stores and a few restaurants/fast food spots, even a Ross, lol. Bed was comfy and everything was clean; it smelled fresh upon arrival! I appreciated the ice in the freezer and extra water. Bonus aesthetic moment for the pretty decorative flowers imprinted on my paper products haha, that was a sweet touch on the paper towels and toilet paper! Place is big enough for 4 people but it’ll just be real friendly up in there! Roberto def makes things super easy and I hardly had any questions. Love the conversion into a small in-law moment and appreciated the privacy as the neighborhood is peaceful and quiet. Only issues I had were the ants (don’t leave food out!) and the shower head being faced an odd direction — water EVERYWHERE! Lol"

Stayed a few nights","Overall the experience was good. The place was clean and easy to access. It was nice the it was it’s own separate place. You didn’t have to go through someone’s house to get where you were going to be sleeping.
Although we had an issues which we found very odd. The day before checking out. We were out all day and came back to an open window in the bedroom we were sleeping.
Someone had came in and open the window while we were out. It was very strange to come back and know is that without any knowledge that someone had walked in.
Nothing was taken just the awkwardness of thinking that someone could come in at anytime."

Stayed one night","Roberto’s place was a perfect location for our road trip from Yosemite to Big Sur. The place was extremely easy to find and self check in was a breeze. The unit appears to be a newer garage conversion and Roberto did a great job with the design. It has a full kitchen with tons of amenities plus coffee pods, creamer and waters. The best amenities were the new HE washer and dryer. We were able to quickly get our laundry done halfway through our trip. He even provided detergent. We were able to relax and watch Netflix as we waited for our laundry to be ready. The unit is on a very quiet residential street, but just about every restaurant/store/supermarket is close by. Overall, we appreciated the space and communication that Roberto provided."

We’d probably recommend staying nearer the coast if you are stayed for 3+ days as there are more things to do."

The only thing was, that it could have been a bit cleaner. You could tell that harder to reach areas and surfaces don’t get much attention. However, toilet, shower and sheets were clean - which to us is the most important thing in the end."

Stayed one night","Roberto was accommodating, friendly, and responded quickly to messages. The space met our needs for a quick and economic stay while in the area for the Big Sur Marathon. We slept comfortably, parking was convenient, entry was easy, the neighborhood was quiet enough, and it was a nice touch to have several bottles of water. The unit is private and appears to be a converted garage. There were a few annoyances (automatic light in bathroom kept turning off and thermostat didn't work but Roberto responded quickly and directed us to a space heater available). Overall happy with our stay and experience with Roberto."

You can hear noise from the main house when you are in the bathroom, but other than that it is quiet. Just be wary that it’s a 30-35 minute drive to Carmel from the place, but it’s an easy drive with main roads for the majority of the trip.
Overall, would recommend staying here and was at a reasonable price."

Stayed a few nights",It got the job done for what i needed at the time. It was basically a house they cut the front off of and added an airbnb. The walls were really thin so you could hear everything from the main house. It looked cleanish but definitely not by a cleaner. Pretty half way done job. I got what I paid for.

I would expect a clean apartment no matter the price."

I went to Salinas for work, and it had strong WiFi, a good space to set up my computer to work, and a kitchen that had everything I needed. It was just right for my stay, and close to friends and my work. Roberto added a space heater during my stay prior to my arrival, which really kept the place warm during the cold and wet days. The place is nothing fancy, but well worth the price. The residential street is very crowded with cars, but it was also very quiet. Getting to downtown Salinas is quick and easy."

Check-in was very efficient. Everything was clean and while we didn’t get to use the washer and dryer or the stove, there’s always next time. We brought our well-behaved dog with us and he enjoyed hanging out too. The pillows were a bit thin but stacking all three of them made sleeping just fine. The mattress was perfect. As others have stated, the couch isn’t the most comfortable but we only used it to watch tv at night. For the price and the peaceful location, this Airbnb pretty much has it all!"

When we couldn’t get the heating system to work, Roberto was very responsive, offering to come and troubleshoot. But it turned out that the space heater he’d provided did a great job heating the space, so we didn’t need his in-person help. We did wish that the previous guest had done a better job cleaning the dishes, but we just washed them before using, as needed."

Stayed a few nights","Cute, cozy place. Very nice and clean. Particularly loved the kitchen! Excellent shower and washer + dryer as well. Host had provided shampoo, conditioner, and body soap as well. Hair dryer was a nice addition! Very small, but nice modern living room and couch (couch is not big enough to sleep on though). Bed actually feels slightly bigger than a normal queen; but the mattress and the pillows are quite worn-out and not the most comfortable anymore. But other than that, really a perfect little place to stay at. Oh, I should note that traffic getting to the Airbnb was quite bad. Once you exit the freeway, you have about a 10-minute drive (normally) to the place. But we arrived during rush hour (around 5pm) and sat in traffic for a good 20-25 minutes after exiting the freeway. So maybe try to avoid this area between 4:30pm-6:30pm if you can as the residential streets are super congested during rush hour."

My only advice to future BNB’ers is to be patient with the heat. Sheryll preheated the spot for us, we turned it up a bit when we arrived, and then ended up too hot. 😀"

It was a little slice of heaven to spend Thanksgiving and reflect on the many things we're thankful for. Many thanks, Sheryll, for your quick reply to questions and for a wonderful stay!"

Stayed a few nights","My sister and I LOVED our stay at the Red Barn Cottage! It is the cutest & cleanest space and has everything you need to have a comfortable stay away from home. The big king bed was 10/10 comfy! There are outlets on directly either side of the bed so there’s no reaching around to find find an outlet to charge your phone.
We especially loved the animals on the property. Meow-Meow and Aspen were competing for our attention and we adored them! They are so funny to hang out with and they’re hard to leave!
Sheryll was super accommodating throughout the entire process. Our incoming flight was cancelled and we couldn’t make it to CA until two days later than scheduled. We were really bummed to have missed out on our time in the area and at the barn cottage but Sheryll was wonderful and adjusted our reservation without even asking. We also appreciated her local recommendations and it was great to chat with her!
If you have the opportunity to come to the Red Barn Cottage, definitely do it!"

Great location to explore by car all that this diverse region has to offer: the productive farms of the ""salad bowl of the USA"" and the John Steinbeck Museum in Salinas, kayaking trips to see the otters and marine life of Elkhorn Slough and Monterey Harbour followed by visits to the Aquarium, the buzz of Cannery Row and Carmel By the Sea, or hikes on beaches and the oak forests of Fremont Peak State Park."

The one thing about this place that wasn’t a problem for us but probably good to know is that there isn’t a lot of noise privacy throughout the barn and the two single beds are right above the bathroom.
The barn is lovingly and tastefully done and I went for a beautiful long walk in the morning straight out the door. We are grateful we stayed here."

Stayed one night","We traveled almost the whole of California over 9 days and this was by far the nicest place we stayed on our whole trip. The hosts live on the property and are available for any questions but they are not invasive. They have a big white dog and a friendly black cat cleverly named Meow Meow - probably because of all the meowing. If you dont like animals, the hosts will gladly make sure they don't bother you. We love animals so they added to the fun. The Air bnb itself is a portion of the barn that they turned into a cottage. It is perfectly proportioned, clean, neat, and well decorated. The beds are comfortbale and the windows offer a nice cross breeze. Fair warning: this is farm country so there was a neighboring donkey to had a lot to say pretty early in the morninig. We would come back and were pleased with Sheryll's communicaiton."

Stayed one night","We've stayed at a number of AirBnB's over the years and this is a top 5 in terms of surroundings, accuracy, and friendliness. You get exactly what you see in the pictures, plus a little bit more. Sheryll provided a good set of directions to find the house because it is in the countryside and down a dark road. Despite arriving in a rain storm, Sheryll still met us outside to say hello and make sure we settled in OK.
The barn house is cozy, heated well, and just enough space for 3-4 people. The loft is a great set up and the king bed in the downstairs bedroom is very comfy. Tall people watch your heads as there are some low ceilings! Also, the kitchen has the perfect amount of dishes and cooking instruments, and your fridge may carry an extra surprise for you for breakfast.
There are chickens around to enjoy as well as cows across the street (they're lowing kept us company at night!). And yes, their dog is super friendly and enjoys a good chin scratch. We'll be back!"

My brother is in general contracting and was so impressed with the quality of how the building has been crafted. A great place to relax with all the amenities. Comfy beds and sofa, beautiful bathroom, adorable and very functional kitchen, and of course the lovely grounds. As described, it's on a rural road, and is a wonderful oasis. We were on a road trip and it was such a relaxing, special stop on our way down the west coast. This is a unique place – don't hesitate to book it. I'd love to come back someday!"

Beds were heavenly. My girls loved sleeping up in the loft, having a toy parade upstairs, and sketching the garden's bounty in their sketchbooks. Truly enjoyed this home away from home! From this central location we were able to visit San Juan Bautista mission, Carmel by the Sea, Monterey, and Santa Cruz. It would also be a great jumping off point for Pinnacles National Park.

Their dog is huge but acts gentle with people. It was funny to also observe the rooster do his thing. The owner advises to not go into the chicken pen.
The Wi-Fi was our biggest worry, but it worked just fine for us. I brought a Fire TV stick so that might help alleviate some streaming concerns if you are into that.

I would recommend that you stay more than one night to enjoy the barn and all of the thoughtful touches added for a comfortable stay. A longer booking would also make the cleaning fee more palatable.
Sheryll was a lovely host who welcomed us as well as giving us plenty of privacy. We were offered the use of a wall charger for our electric car as well which I thought was very kind. The family animals are curious and friendly but don’t come into the cottage - playing with Meow Meow was one of my highlights!"

Will come back again!"

Sheryll and her husband were welcoming and friendly and made sure we felt comfortable. every day our toddler looked forward to our time visiting with the chickens, sitting on the covered front porch and meeting the sweet donkey and mule who live at the property next door. since we had every breakfast and dinner at the cottage, I brought a ton of groceries and perishables with us. the kitchen is petite, but has most everything one needs to cook a full meal - any other kitchen tools that we needed, Sheryll was happy to loan. all in all, it was a wonderful visit and we're looking forward to a future visit."

Nicely decorated, well appointed with enjoyable touches such as a keurig with coffee, creamer, and sugar, oil for cooking, and fresh eggs from her chickens! All the windows were double paned so it was super quiet besides the natural sounds of nature. Sheryll was a fantastic host, was flexible about our arrival and was quick to respond. She totally respected our privacy even though her house is right next door. They do run a construction business in the back of the barn but they did not disturb us at all and you can close the shades if you want absolute privacy.

Stayed with kids","This space looks great in pictures, and unlike a lot of AirBnB's, the reality lived up to the hype! The cottage is beautifully appointed and the construction is solid (not always the case with MIL/private cottage units, or loft-type setups.) Very clean, kitchen had all the necessary amenities, and the natural lighting was perfect all throughout the day. Such a pleasant place to be, I enjoyed just lazing about the property for a couple days during my trip.
The area is beautiful and bucolic (upgrade for my morning runs,) and it was surprisingly quiet at night too, given that you're out in the country. The chickens and family-friendly dogs are just outside if you need some amusement, and the drive to most local towns of interest (Carmel, Monterey, Santa Cruz,) was about 25-40 min (Salinas only 10-15 for necessities or a quick meal.)
Sheryll was a gracious and lovely host with great recommendations for local eats, and even left us some eggs from the chickens, which with the complimentary coffee made breakfasts a breeze. All around 5 stars, would come back again."

We arrived after hiking in the western side of Pinnacles National Park and were delighted by the clean, peaceful cottage. We had plenty of time to savor the takeout food we carried in from Salinas - upload all our hike photos using the WiFi - and then get cozy in the well-equipped sleeping spots. In the morning we used the handy supplies to make a big country breakfast including eggs supplied by our hosts’ hens. It was a plus to have olive oil - we forgot to bring any butter or cooking oil so that really helped that it was supplied in the kitchen. The coffee maker was easy to use also. Then it was back on the road for another day of hiking - this time from the east entrance of Pinnacles. Perfect location for making it to both sides of the park - while enjoying the quiet of the backroads location."

Also, Em was helpful with packages that were delivered to the house (still in contact with him as one UPS box got delivered after we left).

The bed was comfortable and the fresh flowers in the kitchen and bathroom were much appreciated. There were also snacks available and water bottles in the refrigerator. Everything was super clean as well!
Lynne was so responsive and also gave us a lot of information about places to eat and things to do. We ventured out to 17 mile road, Fisherman's Warff and we got up on Saturday and hit the Salinas Farmers Market. I only wish we had time to do more!
I would highly recommend this place. Also, I should mention it has a fun enclosed backyard that is shared with the other tenants. It has a fire pit, couch and games. It is located centrally in Salinas so you can walk to restaurants and to the Saturday Farmer's Market. We will be staying here again if we come back to visit!! Highly recommend!"

Also, the apartment does not have air conditioning installed. The location is close to downtown and the Main Street so there is some late noise.

Stayed one night","Pros: Surprisingly charming spot just off Main Street in downtown Salinas. The interior is wonderfully decorated and very clean. Everything you might need is provided. Lynne is a great host and very responsive. Host willing to accommodate a single-night stay.
Cons: Most windows have a direct view into the Autozone parking lot and signage directly next door (across an open alleyway). Parking is on that ally but again it’s directly visible from Main Street and the neighboring businesses. So a bit less quiet and residential than one might expect.
Overall: Very comfortable and reasonably priced. A bit too snug to bring the whole family, but just right for one or two adult couples staying. Easy access to Monterey-Carmel and the Laguna Seca racetrack. Great host with clear communications. For a quick visit to this area, I’d absolutely stay here again without and hesitations."

Stayed a few nights","At first glance the rental seemed dreamy, with nicely curated decor.
The deal breaker was the ant infestation. It wasn’t just a couple here and there, they were all over floor, bed frame, between the sheets, and pillows, forcing me to abandon the room & sleep on couch.
Sadly, I feel robbed because I didn’t spend my hard-earned money to sleep with ants or on a couch.
I was given a measly 6.93% refund.
The bugs overshadowed my whole experience at this location & that’s all I have to say about that."

Stayed with kids","The apartment is located next to the Main Street of Salinas so it’s within 10 mins drive to some big chain retailers. There’re also some fast food restaurants in walking distance so overall very concenient. The apartment is exactly like what is shown in the photos - a bit aged but quite cozy, and overall clean. It’s a bit packed for 6 people but it’s still within our expectations. May be just right for a family of 4. Although it’s closed to the Main Street, it’s quite quiet at night. Lynne is an amazing host - she always replies to the inquiries very fast and she provides great suggestions of the restaurants. We had a pleasant stay."

Stayed one night","This was such a great place for our weekend getaway to Monterey. Prior to our visit, I asked Lynne if she had any restaurant recommendations, as we weren’t familiar with the area. She produced a huge list of personal favorites, with notes about each, and we ended up having dinner and breakfast from that list, both were a big success. When we arrived at the place, checkin couldn’t have been simpler. We were pleasantly surprised when we got in. The pictures looked nice, but AirBNB listings can be deceptive. Not the case here: the decor was adorable, layout homey, and the amenities were above and beyond what we expected. We could have cooked a full gourmet meal in the kitchen, although the basket of popcorn and snacks would have made it unnecessary. There were tons of towels for our use, extra blankets, and a beautiful bathroom with excellent shower. Basically everything made me feel bad about coming home to my own messy, less tastefully decorated house and wishing I could be back there for another night. The area felt safe and comfortable in terms of leaving my car parked in the provided spot just outside, and it was only a few min drive to downtown. All in all, highly recommend for a family or a group of friends looking for an elegant and cozy place to stay while exploring the area."

You are directly across from an auto zone and the main road. It does get pretty noisy at night with constant cars racing. There are also cats outside who like to use the roof as their jungle gym in the middle of the night. No fault to the host, but it did make it seem creepier at night."

There is plenty of outdoor space to hang out in and relax as well as plenty of games and things to keep you busy inside. She did a great job of recommendations for not only Salinas but surrounding areas. We definitely used several of her recommendations and we were not disappointed. They have thought of everything. Kitchen was absolutely beautiful and seemed to have everything you’d need to make meals. We didn’t cook but I did check it out. We didn’t come with the intention of really hanging out in Salinas but there’s actually quite a lot to do. I think we’ll come back to to play around in their cute downtown next time. The area felt safe and well kept. Lots of walkable restaurants too. Thank you for such a beautiful place to relax and celebrate my daughter’s birthday in. ❤️❤️"

The space is just like the photos and is clean and incredibly well-stocked (linens, pillows, cookware, snacks, toiletries, etc). With only your suitcase you could comfortably move in, so would be great for a long/extended stay. We stayed in winter so, unfortunately, didn’t get to take full advantage of the outdoor facilities. Lynne has impressively managed to create a comfy, cozy, private space right in the middle of the Downtown Area.
What really sets this space apart is Lynne, the host. She is responsive, easy to communicate with and helpful. She is the best of what Airbnb aims to be. I only hope this place is available when we next want to head to the Monterey Bay area."

Stayed a few nights","Lynne's place was even nicer than it looks in the photos! My friend was absolutely wow-ed when we entered. For a couple of design nerds like us, it was a really fun and beautiful place to stay. We really appreciated the decor details, everything was comfortable, and the kitchen had absolutely everything we needed to make a couple delicious dinners. Although we were there on a work trip, the house is clearly designed for fun. There is an entire dresser full of games and the shared backyard area looked like the perfect space to hang out on a friend's trip.
Lynne was always lovely and responsive to any messages or questions we had, and the other people we saw around the property were always very kind and smiling.
I would absolutely stay at this welcoming spot again on my next trip to Monterey!"

It had plenty of amenities.. games to play while relaxing in the back courtyard.
Lynne’s Airbnb has spoiled me to never book a hotel in Salinas, My friend & I was sad the 4 day stay had come to an end. Looks just like the pictures… I will always book this property when I’m in Salinas."

It was centrally located for us fairly close to Santa Cruz and Monterey.
We enjoyed walking to dinner in Salinas in the evening.
I didn’t realize the floor was concrete until I arrived but it seemed pretty clean, even when wearing socks.
The shared back yard was really cute! We enjoyed playing corn hole several times. Twice, other guests used the shared back yard while we were there, which is right out the sliding Patio doors of our unit. They weren’t too loud and didn’t stay out for more than an hour, so it wasn’t a big deal.
I loved the large magnified makeup mirror in the bathroom!
Best of all, Lynne reaponded within minutes to every question and was sooo nice!
I definitely would recommend."

It felt like home right away and had everything we needed and more, including a well equipped kitchen, snacks and waters, and lots of extra towels (and beach towels, too!). Lynne is a fantastic host - very communicative, attentive and friendly. She gave us tons of great recommendations for local restaurants and places to see that matched our interests, which came in handy as the location is perfect to explore the Big Sur area as well as Santa Cruz, with quick and easy access to several freeways. The neighborhood is quiet and safe, and the backyard a peaceful spot to relax with our morning coffee or a glass of wine at night. Cannot recommend it enough!!"

My son slept on the couch (which was really comfortable!) and my daughter used the roll-away bed. We found the studio to be welcoming and comfortable from the moment we walked in. There were even generous snacks waiting for us that helped the teens manage before we could get to the grocery store :). Lynne’s attraction and restaurant recommendations were incredibly helpful and added so much to our trip. She is incredibly responsive and answered our questions right away. The location is charming and Salinas is a great town to explore in its own. I could not recommend this studio more! Thank you for making our vacation so memorable!!

Lynne provided me with a large number of excellent suggestions weeks in advance of our arrival which made it easy to plan out what to do. Very detailed and helpful.
The only minor con was some bugs. We noticed some small ants in the bathroom and there were a bunch of flying bugs near the overhang at the front of the unit. But nothing that impacted our stay."

Lynne's place is such a thoughtfully designed space that put me at peace as I was on pins and needles for my exam (it went fine). Once you get inside, it is such a beautiful oasis. There are two areas outside where you can lounge in a secluded space, you forget you are right next to a commercial space. Inside it is so spacious and luxurious. We loved the unique designs including the beautiful lighting, the bathroom sink made out of an old dresser, and the comfortable bed. I also loved the sliding doors and the vent above the stove. We felt right at home putting our foods away in the fridge and watching a silly movie on appletv. Theres also a lot of blankets in the closets to snuggle up in. Communicating with Lynn was very easy. She had clear instructions with pictures and she answered every one of messages. Lynn is also such a lovely, caring person."

My friends and I were in town for a race in nearby Toro Park and Lynne's studio offered us an oasis for rest and peace, a real home away from home. For three girls, there was more than enough towels, linens, and blankets to go around, as well as multiple separate bed options (the queen air mattress was wonderful, by the way). There were also complimentary snacks, ground coffee, shampoo/conditioner/bodywash, and a number of kitchen basics to cook with (we definitely made use of that!), which were great as not all Airbnbs provide full amenities. We were also really impressed by how easy it was to check-in and find everything we needed. Our arrival was very late in the night and everything was very clearly communicated in the check-in instructions. Overall, a wonderful place to stay and would highly recommend to anyone else traveling to the area!"

Stayed one night","Had a great stay at this beautiful Air Bnb for a night on a father/son golf trip! Absolutely beautiful, big, bright space that was super easy to find and in/out of the unit! This unit is very safe and secure, with a dead bolted gate and Ring security to monitor vehicles/people in the parking area. Once in the gate, the property is very private, with your own entry on the right hand side. We stayed at the unit one night, and we wish we could have stayed some more. The hosts recommendations for local Mexican cuisine were excellent! Check out Villa Azteca (traditional Mexican cuisine) in downtown Salinas for some of the tastiest, regional Mexican food around. (The ribeye Aguachile was the best I’ve ever had). Huge props to the owner for being responsive and thorough! A must stop in Salinas. Cheers guys!"

Lynne was communicative and available to help with anything I needed. The place has lots of thoughtful extras like a mini snack bar. I felt right at home! I met Lynne on my last day out, she made a moment to connect with me and was warm and welcoming host and lovely to connect with. Thank you Lynne for everything! Would definitely love to go back and would recommend this place to anyone!"

Stayed a few nights","We really enjoyed our stay here. Lynne is an excellent AirBnB—she’s helpful, responds to questions quickly, and offers great recommendations. The place is very cute—it’s unique and has many thoughtful touches (snacks, coffee and creamer, lots of towels, extra blankets, etc.). It was clean, comfy, and located near restaurants (many walking distance). We had a couple hiccups with the parking that were a mild inconvenience, but Lynne addressed them quickly. We made this our home base for exploring Pinnacles NP, and it would be a perfect base for exploring Salinas, Monterey, Carmel, etc. we felt super comfortable, safe, and happy here. 100% would stay here again."

Stayed with kids","Our family of 3 (including a 7 year old) stayed at Lynne's place for a weekend in Salinas. The space was comfortable and tastefully decorated. Although we didn't do much cooking, we appreciated the full kitchen with all the amenities needed for making a meal. Our kiddo particularly enjoyed the snack basket (thanks, Lynne!) and the many board games and outdoor games available. It was pretty cold while we were in town, otherwise we probably would have used the back patio area much more. We'll have to come back to enjoy the fire pit. There was a twin sized roll-away bed that worked well for our kiddo. Lynne was extremely helpful and very thoughtful and kind. She provided local vegan restaurant recommendations for our vegan family, and knowing that we were in town on a sad occasion, she checked in on us to make sure we were all set."

We stayed here for 3 nights to explore nearby Big Sur and go to the Monterey Bay aquarium, and Lynne was able to share a wonderful family friendly hike that was so scenic, we can't wait to return (Point Lobos State Natural Reserve). The entire stay matched Lynne's photos and description (and then some!), and while we didn't get to use all the amenities while we were running around sightseeing, next time, we would definitely take advantage and plan a relaxing day/night in and play some backyard games and indoor board games and just enjoy the ambiance. Thank you, Lynne! We hope to come back, soon!"

We got to meet Lynne & chat with her during our stay. She was really sweet & offered our kids toys to play with. She also recommended we dine at Villa Azteca & it was delicious. If you go definitely order the enchiladas verdes. They were so good!

There a basic amenities in the kitchen to whip up a quick meal. The beds and pillows were fantastic - very cozy and comfortable.
From this location - it takes you to Monterey and Carmel in about 25 mins and about an hour to Big Sur.
Very close by, there is a huge Tesla supercharger next to a Target which was a WIN for us.
Also highly recommend Cafe Eva's for the best Mexican food we've had (Make sure you to order a to-go order)
Lastly Martha is a wonderful hostess— Kind, accommodating and a clear communicator
Overall 10/10 experience"

Stayed about a week","We were very pleased with the apartment. It is lovingly decorated, very clean and we felt very much at home.
In the kitchen there was everything you could ask for. For us, it was especially nice that there were also children's dishes (we have two children 3+5).
The children were very satisfied to walk around and play in the small front yard. Also a large playground was two far away.
Martha was very helpful and straightforward in communicating."

Stayed a few nights","I've stayed in dozens of Airbnbs, and Martha's place is easily in the top five. Her space exactly -- and I do mean *exactly* -- matches the photos and description. It's as clean, uncluttered, comfortable and quiet as advertised, and the amenities that are too often in short supply in so many other places -- a wide variety of kitchen utensils, extra towels and blankets, flat surfaces to put luggage on -- are found in abundance here. And the extra half bathroom is a huge bonus. From the start, Martha was clear, friendly and responsive about check-in, parking (which is off-street -- another nice bonus) and everything else. If you're visiting the coast and don't want to pay $500-$750/night for a space half this size, Martha's unit offers spectacular value within a 15-minute drive of Seaside. Not only would I stay here again, but I plan to specifically search for it next time I'm embarking on a Monterey/Carmel/Big Sur trip. Thank you, Martha!"

The accommodations were great for four adults; plenty of space, nice beds and bathroom/shower. The in-unit heater was not working, but that was well communicated and there were space heaters provided (which we didn't need anyways thanks to the nice and cozy duvets and blankets for chilling on the couch). All in all, a very comfortable and pleasant space to stay in while checking out the Salinas/Monterey area. Do recommend!"

Stayed with kids","Jianpings home is close enough to the Monterey area, Santa Cruz and Big Sur. The location if the home was in a quiet residential area. My family and I felt that there was a slight smell in the home, a mixture of cigarette and dampness. The home had most items needed. Although we were a family of nine, it did lack towels enough for our group (good thing we brought some of our own). We felt that the kitchen lacked some regular frying pans, even for light cooking. The master bedroom lacked privacy in the bathroom (facing outside front door), the glass window did not have a curtain or shade, so someone walking up to the house might be able to slight see you. Please be aware of checking time, Jianping was not flexible. We were limited to one couch in the living room, as the we noticed one had a few ants. We noticed left over food, in the corner by the sofa, so we're assuming that's why they were there. I address the issue to Jianping and she asked that I use bug spray that's in the garage."

The home is very clean and had linens/towels for all. Showers included shampoos/conditioner and body wash.
We loved the location, as it enabled us to make many day trips to visit places with our 80 year old parents. San Francisco is under 2 hours away, kayaking in Moss Landing is 20 minutes away, Monterey/Carmel-by the-Sea, and a day trip to Big Sur are all nearby and we had a comfortable place to return to each night for board and card games.
We would stay in Jianping’s home again."

The house is quite large, in a quiet neighbourhood close to shops and restaurants, and had all the amenities we needed for a comfortable stay. We appreciated how responsive Jianping was as well! Highly recommend this place."

Stayed with kids","The guy was very nice and mention a few stuff that we forgot. We weren’t able to get it but it was very thoughtful. The house was very spacious, and the kids enjoyed it however the biggest downside to it was the heavy smelling of Raid spray throughout the whole house. We first thought it was due to the fact that he had those electrical wicked air fresheners but that wasn’t it. The smell was so strong that I had to mention it, and hopefully anyone that has asthma and sensitive smelling please avoid this place. But other than that the place was 5 out of 5."

Stayed a few nights","This is a nice mid-century home in a quiet family neighborhood. Jianping is a great host with excellent communication. Central location for anyone visiting the Salinas/Monterey Bay Area. While simply decorated, all furniture is comfortable, nice Smart TV & WiFi, and beds seem new. Kitchen was modestly equipped but had all the basics we needed. We were in the area for work. The home was a good quiet respite after a long day. House is a short drive from both Main Street & Westridge Shopping areas.
I’d recommend for families who need space for a fair price.
Good size patio in backyard for outdoor fun as well."

Nice neighborhood and we were utterly enamored with the sweet “watchdog” in the back yard. Wanted to do a Steinbeck trip for many years and this was the perfect place for our stay. 20 minutes to the Monterey area for some Cannery Row and Monterey Bay sightseeing. Managed to snag a first edition Steinbeck at the downtown Salinas bookstore as well. Highly recommended! ￼￼"

Salinas itself was very quiet and had a lot to offer as well, we would’ve explored within the city more if we had stayed another day or two but theres always next time.
I would recommend staying here.
We had a chance to have a quick chat with David on our way out, he was so sweet and made us feel very welcomed.

Spoilt for choice on what to do, from sea otter spotting at moss landing to the aquarium. You can easily drive down the coast via big sur, we didn’t this time but there was still plenty to do. If you’re staying over the weekend be sure to check out the farmers market in downtown 10 minute walk away. David was super friendly and very accommodating. We have a lovely stay and enjoyed the company of drummer his sweet and friendly dog in the evenings. Highly recommend. Will stay here again if we’re in the area."

You will hear any walking about that is going on over your head, but David is not a late night party person and it was minimal considering how close it is. The bed has a memory foam pad, but if you hate those the way I do it is easy enough to remove for your stay. The kitchen is well appointed and has many of the items that you might not want to purchase for a limited stay. I hope to stay again on one of my regular visits to Salinas. Spacious for a studio."

One thing I really appreciate (that other places neglect) is space to store your personal items. There is a somewhat steep ramp down into the backyard entrance which could be difficult for those with mobility problems. And you will hear walking and television noises from above. Overall, a very nice stay."

Stayed a few nights","I stayed here for a golf event I had in the Pebble Beach area right before the July 4th holiday. I found it easy to commute to the golf course each day. The price was right and is a great value. The unit is spacious, clean, everything updated. The kitchen is great- it's like a home away from home. The home is on the corner of a busy street so there could be traffic noise. It is the lower level of the host's home so you will hear people above you. Both of these were not a deal breaker for me, but something to expect when staying here. David was very responsive and helpful. I would stay here again."

My partner and I came to the area to explore Big Sur and Monterey county and David’s spot was the best home base. We felt so relaxed the entire time. We will definitely be returning."

Stayed a few nights","David's place is a gem, and David himself is equally wonderful!
I was particularly impressed with the incredibly upscale kitchen--it's huge, looks like it could be in a magazine, and is stocked with every piece of kitchen equipment one could ever need to cook lavish meals. And with the mattress, which was infinitely more comfortable than my own bed at home.
Despite being right near the downtown area of Salinas, David's place feels like a total oasis. The yard is all in bloom with an extraordinary array of happy plants, and there's a lovely space to sit and soak in the evening sunshine surrounded by the peace and beauty David has nurtured.
I enjoyed going for morning runs around the neighborhoods and on the nearby Hartnell College track, and I found the location extremely convenient for errands of all sorts (bank, dry cleaners, groceries, etc.)
David was super respectful of my space yet quite thoughtful, including checking in on me the first day to make sure I was comfortable. I felt so cared for and so at home!
Also, I'm not a dog person but the two dogs were so sweet that I am, as of meeting them, becoming more of a dog person :)
Thank you David! Hope to be back again soon."

For hiking, it's roughly equidistant to the Pinnacles National Park west entrance and to California state parks south of Carmel (and the drive to the Pinnacles east entrance is reasonable and through pretty country). David is most accommodating."

Stayed about a week","This lovely studio is absolutely perfect for a single or couple. It's on the lower level of the house, facing the back yard that is filled with light, flowers, and tangerines (yes, tangerines). The kitchen is well-equipped, the shower hot and strong, and the bed -- well, I can't remember, as I slept so very well. The place is new, lovely, and a real bargain. The location in Salinas is super, only about a 10 minute walk to Main Street, 30 minutes to Pebble Beach, and a bit further to Big Sur, Pinnacles National Park, and more. David is a lovely gentleman, but the true stars of the show are his two wonderful dogs, Drummer and Cassie. They were the perfect welcoming canine hosts!"

Stayed a few nights","David's place was perfect for our few days exploring the Big Sur. Don't be fooled by the pictures - this studio is SO much bigger than it looks and so much cozier than the photos as well. It's perfect for solo travelers or couples. We reached the airbnb in the evening and it was quite dark but thanks to David's specific descriptions and photos we were easily able to check in without any issues.
The studio was clean and cozy, and there are tons of outlets everywhere which is great and even a few charging wires too! The bed is big and comfy, one that is soft and you sink into which I personally didn't love but my partner did :) The location itself is about half an hour away from Monterey and Carmel in a smaller quiet town which we actually liked.
I would absolutely stay again and would recommend this to everyone as long as their group size is right! this was WAY better than our stay at 4 star hotel in SF!"

Stayed a few nights","Davids place was a great stay. He took the time to answer all of my questions and was very prompt. check in details were very specific and house was easy to find because of it. The two furbabies were adorable and so friendly. Everything was spotless when we arrived and smelled a mixture of new and like grandmas house ( not a bad smell like comforting and not dull)The kitchen is beautiful and the bed is so comfy. the couches felt vintage with the pattern but got that comfy feel. Roku tv had great streaming options , though missing youtube but that's an easy fix. It is a downstairs/basement studio however it was so quiet when we stayed we weren't sure if anyone was home until the dogs were let in lol Bathroom is beautiful , shower is great ( love the shower tabs) When I go back to Salinas/Monterey I hope I am able to stay with David again. Highly recommended stay."

The kitchen was fully stocked and beautiful. Love the granite. The bathroom is lovely. This space is very homey and spacious. Dave has two dogs that are super sweet and love cuddles and treats. His outdoor space is perfect for enjoying coffee in the morning. Very peaceful and quiet. Didn’t feel like the middle of Salinas. The location feels very secluded but then also so close to breakfast spots and only 30 min away from Monterey and Carmel. We will definitely return next year!

Stayed a few nights","The entry is through a wooden gate and you are surprised by a big (yet friendly) dog that greats you immediately, the unit is all the way in the back of the complex. Make sure to get the lock box code early our you may be left waiting a couple hours for Dave to respond when you try to get in. The unit is pretty cozy. No lock in the bathroom. There is a door that looks like a pantry in the kitchen which actually leads to some storage room and stairs to Dave's unit and cannot be locked from inside the rental unit which is creepy. We got some rope to tie off the door knob to the kitchen cabinet to prevent unwanted entry. Was good thing we did cause I did notice on the day that Dave knew we left to Monterey, the rope was stretched indicating that someone tried to come in through that door! On Sunday night he had some friends over and we could here them yelling/fighting and loud music playing late into the night while we tried to sleep (walls/floor are thin so sound travelled). We will definitely not stay here ever again."

The location is perfect if you want to take a quick stroll around the neighborhood but close enough to the beaches and cities that if you needed anything from anywhere you could get there quick and easy. It’s a beautiful place and it’s got a very cabin-like homey feeling to it. Would definitely recommend and we’re looking forward to coming back soon!

Stayed a few nights","Dave's place was amazing!! We came down from 110 degree heat to go to the Monterey Bay and Santa Cruz and found this hidden gem for a fraction of the price of others, especially given it was a holiday weekend. It was my first Airbnb booking so I was a bit nervous about what to expect, but upon arrival, Dave was available and put us right at ease. He was articulate, considerate, and extremely gracious; making us feel welcome and at home. He has two of the sweetest dogs ever, Cassie and Drummer, who after our insistence were allowed to come out and visit us. We simply adored them. We spent the daytime in Monterey and Santa Cruz and the evening at the house, out on the patio with a glass of wine and surrounded by his beautiful yard with various flowers and wildlife. There was even a robin nesting right by the front door! Dave offered to make a fire in the fire pit and we were able to watch several amazing firework displays right from the backyard. Dave was a great host, so we invited him to visit with us while we enjoyed the fireworks. The rest of the time, he let us know he was available should we need anything, recommending great places to eat and ways to maximize our timing for driving and visiting the different areas.The rest of the time we did not see him and he is more than willing to be invisible if preferred. The ""studio"" is anything but that in size! It is more like an apartment with a separate bathroom and dressing/closet area and a full kitchen! Everything needed was provided, there were kitchen utensils, tools, stove, oven, microwave, coffee maker with delicious local coffee and a bottle of wine. He even had three different types of chargers at both nightstands, two couches, and a good-sized smart TV. The bathroom was spacious and modern with a wonderful shower/tub with near instant HOT water with awesome pressure! The windows kept it light and airy, while sufficiently covered with blinds to provide great privacy and darkness should you want to sleep in or nap. I cannot say enough about this place and the host and it's central location. It did this nurses heart and soul much good after a weary year with Covid and long hours and stress. What a blessing that I will be sure to take part in again!! Thanks, Dave!!!"
