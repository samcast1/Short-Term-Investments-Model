Group trip","We enjoyed our stay at the Moscow Flat. The directions provided by the hosts were proactive and very clear given its access from the alley. The Flat was clean and immaculate and had all the amenities and more. A welcome basket complete with a bottle of wine, fruit and muffins along with water and yogurt in the fridge were greatly appreciated!! I cannot comment on the price we paid as it was over a university graduation weekend where prices are inflated everywhere. It was certainly less than booking 2 hotel rooms on this weekend. We were grateful to find this flat and definitely recommend to others staying in the Moscow/Pullman area!"

Stayed a few nights","My daughter and I were in town for an event at the university. The loft was near the campus and also downtown - super convenient! The neighborhood is older and access is in an alleyway, but did not feel unsafe, just not ""pretty"". The loft itself was clean and updated with plenty of space. We thought the beds were very comfortable and liked that there is a fireplace and lots of extra blankets. Everything was easy to find and communication with the hosts was easy with clear directions. We will definitely look for the loft the next time we are back in Moscow. Thanks!"

Stayed one night","Ty and Lenora were great hosts. From the minute we booked to the time we checked out, they went above and beyond to accommodate us. We asked for an early check in due to the football game and they didn’t hesitate to accommodate. We know this was an imposition, due to the rapid cleaning schedule, and yet, they we were eager to help. Not to mention, they were great communicators, always quick to respond to any questions we had.
As for the condo itself, it was everything they described on the listing. Very new, very clean and set up well for two couples. It was comfortable and warm too with the fireplace being a nice touch. We’d definitely stay here again. In fact, we tried booking for our next weekend and it was already gone.
Thanks again Lenora and Ty!
Cheer, Brian & Dotti Price"

Where other AB&B owners often forget the little things, Ty and Lenora have done a wonderful job of making sure their guests have everything they need; from cooking utensils, to seasoning, laundry, washcloths, paper towels, great coffee maker - often the little things other owners forget about; and it made the stay so much more enjoyable. We’ll definitely be back."

Stayed a few nights","We have stayed in quite a few airbnbs in several countries, and we were so happy and fortunate to find Ty & Lenora’s place for a three-night stay and an autumn ramble in the Palouse! Their apartment is wonderfully appointed and so comfortable.
We appreciated the big comfy armchair and comfortable sofa — with a throw blanket to cozy up in, the spacious outdoor deck, the awesome water filter. Lots of storage, lots of things for kids/baby, and simply but so beautifully decorated.
Close enough to stroll to Moscow’s very cool downtown, so we visited Neat whiskey bar, twice! Try their whiskey smash, yummmm
I hope we can come back and stay again! Thanks for your sweet space"

We enjoyed the table and chairs on the deck and the space to spread out. There were lots of little touches to make it feel like home, which we appreciated. Hosts were super responsive and very friendly and able to let us check in a little early which was very much appreciated. We’d definitely stay at Ty and Lenora’s again!"

We didn't really use the kitchen but was well stocked for your cooking needs, plenty of space to store food for short and long stays. The bathroom was literally immaculate. shampoo, conditioner, body soap, qtips, and flossers available. nice thick towels. laundry soap available, linens for beds super clean and fresh smelling. beautifully decorated and a home feel, I literally said I would live here, lol. If we are ever in Moscow, we will stay here, no need to look any further."

Stayed with kids","My family of five with three under five and both sets of the grandparents did both sides of this listing (the loft and the flat) and that worked great! The amenities the loft had for the kids were so nice to have (toys, games, books, high chair, pack n play!) and they slept great on the pull out couch downstairs in the flat. We had a baby in the pack n play with us upstairs. It was a bit tight with so many of us, but worked just fine! The upstairs loft living room was a great place to spend time together. The hosts were so helpful in getting us an early check in so our kids could rest and get ready for a nighttime event. We were close to everything we wanted to visit on Main and would love to come back!"

The cottage has everything you need - super comfy bed, spotless well-appointed kitchen, a great reading couch in a sunny window, a really quiet neighborhood, and all a quick walk over to Main Street for whatever you need, and the whole place is super clean, uncluttered, and tastefully decorated. Our hosts were very responsive and unobtrusive, left lights and heat on for my very late arrival, a nice welcome note and bottle of wine much appreciated as well. It feels like a home away from home, will absolutely return again next time I'm in town."

Although we were doing meals with family and didn't cook beyond coffee, the kitchen was outstanding for layout, stove, equipment and set-up including oil & vinegar, spices, some coffee and cream. Very clean and uncluttered. Hannah & Marshall are very together hosts."

Stayed over a week","Kris was a great host! He was a very good communicator and very helpful. There are two things guests need to know before arrival. There is a small portable clothing rack in the bedroom but no dresser. The kitchen was very clean but did not have some items needed to cook with such as measuring cups, measuring spoons and a casserole dish.
I love the location as it is within walking distance of downtown and area restaurants. The unit has a fence so I felt safe and secure. And Kris is a wonderful host and always available by phone or messaging."

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay in Moscow. The location worked well for graduation weekend. We walked downtown to eat at restaurants but drove to the far end of campus for events. It is also close to Republic on Main (formerly Identity). We stayed for four days and had three guests. That worked well for bed accommodations. I would not recommend it for four adults with the couch/bed. The extra partial bathroom was nice. The full-sized refrigerator, freezer, stove and microwave were great to have. There is a Keurig available you just need to bring your own pods.
Room was clean and air conditioning worked well. My only complaint was for the higher cost over graduation weekend we were only given one backup roll of toilet paper for a four day stay. When I contacted our host with a day and a half remaining asking if we could get more he was not able to get any to us before we left. We were able to use tissues instead but I expected it to be better stocked especially for what we paid."

There is plenty of room for a blowup bed if needed. The extra half bath was great to have. Enjoyed walking to the Co-op for a few grocery items. Check in and check out was a breeze.

Even though it snowed we stayed warm and loved being able to see the snow fall from the coziness of the couch and or bed after a long day. The space heater in the bathroom was especially nice. The smart tv kept us entertained and the bed was especially comfortable. We were able to find a great Italian restaurant in town thanks to Carole-Anne’s local food suggestion binder. The personal gretting card with trail suggestions was a lovely touch, too!
We are planning to stay here again next time we pass through Idaho."

The place was full of thoughtful details, like blackout curtains in the bedroom and living room, screens on all the windows, fans and space heaters to adjust the temperature if necessary, snacks, and good towels. We will definitely look to stay at Dawn's place again next time we are in Moscow."

The home is located in a nice neighborhood that feels safe and walkable. Dawn is a wonderful host; responsive and proactive. While the kitchen is more of a place to make toast and coffee, there are many local restaurants to enjoy nearby. The bed is very comfortable. There are plenty of fresh towels in the nicely updated bathroom. Lots of extra bedding for the pull out sofa sleeper which was also comfy. Overall, this was a cute and cozy place to stay while we were at our daughter’s graduation."

1) The apartment is in an adorable, historic neighborhood. Big mature trees and lovely homes abound.
2) Dawn must have attended interior design school because the place is absolutely darling. She really has an eye for aesthetics.
3) The apartment was clean and tidy. It was as if we were the first people to stay there.
4) Most impressive was how Dawn anticipates your every need. When we arrived, we were met with a basket full of snacks and a friendly note. Forgotten toiletries? Dawn's got you! From cold filtered water in the fridge to colorful, framed maps of the Moscow area to coffee to-go cups, her attentiveness knows no bounds.
We will stay here every time we visit Moscow!"

The loft is darling with great decor, the neighborhood is charming and felt safe, the neighbors were friendly and it was easily walkable. There were great restaurants and boutiques on Main Street. For good eats, we loved the “Breakfast Club”. And there’s a delicious Thai place off second street that we walked too and ate outside next to a fire pit. If you’re considering a trip to Moscow, you’ll find a hidden gem here. We had a perfect, relaxing girls weekend."

Great location only a few blocks (walking takes only a few minutes) from eating breakfast, lunch and dinner. we walked a couple different times to eat. The location is nestled into a cute neighborhood and is so pretty with all the trees changing colors.
Dawn had every amenity possible including toothpaste and toothbrush. (For my high school senior who is touring colleges, he of course forgot his toothbrush and we hadn’t made it to target yet, so that was super appreciated!!) All the coffee /tea and fixin’s to go with it. The cozy soft blankets were perfect for a cold autumn 🍂 stay! I wish I could stay more often but from Southern California it makes it almost impossible. But maybe not- my son and I loved U of I and he just may become a Vandal . 🎉
And then… I left two things behind and she sent them back to me. One of them was a favorite blouse of mine. I can’t say enough nice things about her and how cute the place was. And her kids were an added bonus.
Very Nice !! You wont regret staying here.

Stayed a few nights","Dawn is an amazing host. She’s ready to help but gives you your space at the same time. Even though there isn’t a kitchen sink or stove - the microwave and the refrigerator, Keurig and all of the supplies she provides make it all work. I used the bathroom sink easily for water and she even provided a pitcher and filter to use in the fridge.
The bedroom has lots of space and wonderful windows. I loved the furniture etc… not too cluttered and very very peaceful.
Location is close to everything and I walked everywhere easily even in the rain!!! Its a beautiful neighborhood and a lovely home!!
I will be back for another stay.
Thank you Dawn"

The location is great and you can walk anywhere downtown.
This would also be a good spot to rent for a small family."

We loved how close her house was to everything , and it was so hip and cute.
The neighborhood is lovely - - treed lined streets, tulips everywhere!
We felt very safe.
Dawn has thought of every detail. We had everything we needed. She was very responsive to all my questions and needs."

Stayed with kids","Dawn’s place was such a great find. The construction upgrades were beautifully done while still respecting the “old house” charm. We were pleased to find a deep soaking tub in the bathroom! The space is beautifully decorated, and Dawn didn’t miss a single detail when it comes to making guests feel welcome. We were greeted with snacks and a personalized note, there were several phone chargers available, we found a high chair tucked away for our babe’s meal time, and she even had cough drops and cold medicine in the bathroom which were a lifesaver when we all came down with a cold the first night of our stay. It’s also within walking distance of downtown Moscow, including the incredible Saturday morning Farmer’s Market."

Stayed with kids","Dawn's place is the best you can get in the area. The location is ideal, with downtown and UI at walking distance, located at the heart of beautiful Fort Russell. The place is perfectly quiet, with streets beautifully lined with old tall trees. The place itself is airy and well lit with lots of natural light coming in. The space has everything one could possibly need on a short visit and Dawn has it supplied with lots of sample sized products such as shampoo, conditioner, lotions, toothpaste, extra toothbrushes, etc. The Keurig coffee bar is well stocked with many options, including decaf. The place is a perfect landing pad for people in town for visits! Dawn was particularly welcoming, her instructions are clear and she provides plenty of ideas of what to do without being intrusive. We will definitely use this place again when it is free for our visit and recommend to close friends."

She is great at communicating, the check-in and checkout were seamless, and there is plenty of room to work, relax, and unwind. Her home is within walking distance of many attractions, restaurants, downtown, and the university. We loved out three days away in her charming upstairs apartment and will stay again the next time we find ourselves in Moscow."

That said, we had to leave a night early because of the noise upstairs, it was impossible to sleep in the bedroom from 3:30am to 7:30am the two nights we stayed. Seems like this isn’t a consistent problem so maybe we were unlucky."

Stayed with kids","I was traveling for an athletic tournament with two kiddos, and this place was such a perfect fit. It was almost half the price of the hotel that the team stayed at, and so cozy that we actually hung out at the place more than we usually do when traveling. There were so many sweet details, from welcoming chocolates to a very well- equipped kitchen, to even a topper for the couch-bed. There were multiple coffee making options, water purifier, and plenty of supplies. The place was very clean and in GREAT condition. We loved being able to walk to great cafe's within one block, and heard NO road noise. Even met a great neighbor. We would definitely stay again."

Stayed a few nights","First time here. It was just as other guest comments had said. Nice place, clean but a little small. Good for one or two people. Tight parking but not too bad. There is also street parking if needed. They provide earplugs which my wife and I both used for sleeping due to the mild traffic noise at night and the early rising upstairs neighbors. (Not sure if that is a short term rental too. Your experience may be different.) We may stay there again if the rates are a little lower. It was parents weekend at the college so everything was expensive or booked. Good location in town generally but it is not in a residential area. Check-in instructions were self explanatory. I never even had to contact the hosts directly."

Stayed one night","""Cute"" does not describe this location at all. Very comfortable environment with all the items you need (including Q-tips in the bathroom). It was a little cool when we arrived but the wall-mounted heaters in each room warmed the place up quickly. There's a major road outside but I didn't notice any noise but enjoyed all the great places to eat along that road that were all in walking distance. Instructions to and access were very clear and Julia answered all my questions (first time to Moscow) quickly. Loved the welcome items (don't know where the chocolates disappeared to when my wife wasn't looking). This is a ""must"" on my list when we come back to spend some more time exploring the area."

Good soap and shampoo, with a large showerhead and great water pressure.
The TV has tons of channels and the bed was super comfortable.
Joshua and Julia sent all the info I needed to check in/ check out and were available if I needed anything. I enjoyed not seeing or hearing another person the whole time I was there. Really felt like my own apartment.
Staying here makes travel so much easier because so many must have cooking items are already there.

Stayed a few nights","First of all, the hosts are very nice. The inside of the apartment was nicely decorated.However, the parking is very tight and narrow. If I had brought the truck I would not have been able to get into the parking space. There is nowhere to turn around and I had to back out between the garage and a trailer. The inside of the apartment smelled of fish and other strong cooking odors and I had to walk back out because it gave me a headache.
The apartment is right on a busy road and there is a big basket of ear plugs sitting there for guests to use.
I should have noticed that there are no pictures of the outside of the apartment complex. My fault for not paying better attention.
I ended up not staying there and the hosts were very nice and quickly refunded my money."

Communication with Josh and Julia was easy. The place is super cute and clean. We did have some trouble finding a spot to park my daughters car but there is a new parking lot kiddie corner to the property where we parked for 3 nights with no problems. With it being a basement unit, there is some noise from the folks upstairs. We bought a fan for the bedroom because it was pretty hot but also because it helped as white noise to buffer the sound. All in all was a great stay, we will be back!"

It is clean and updated. Many little touches that made you feel that they truly cared about making your stay comfortable.
It is in a basement so there was a little bit of noise from upstairs but not bad. They do provide ear plugs just in case but I did not find a need to use them.
The parking is a bit tight but had no issues getting in and out.
I would definitely stay again"

It has a little Joanna Gaines vibe going on…the only thing you’ll need to come prepared for is there is no AC and unfortunately the hosts didn’t provide any fans either. It really needs a fan in the bedroom and livingroom to sleep by and to get through the hottest part of the day. And other than the towels not being enough of, I can’t really complain, this was the nicest littlest place. Has a washer and dryer too!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a great place to stay if you’re in Moscow! Across the street from downtown, but it is quiet. It is a basement unit, but it gets a lot of natural light and stayed pretty cool even though the outside temperatures were high 80s-90s the week we stayed and there is no AC in the unit. We were comfortable without it. There are units up above, so you do hear the tenants throughout the day, but they weren’t terribly loud (the hosts did provide earplugs, which we thought was a thoughtful and funny detail. Never had to use them though- the neighbors are respectful and I didn’t stay with a snorer lol! ). Throughout the apartment you can tell the hosts paid attention to detail- the unit is beautiful and homey and had everything you could need in case you forgot to pack anything. The bed was very comfortable! Overnight parking is behind the building through a small alleyway, but it was fairly easy to navigate, so no issues there. We did meet some of the neighbors as we walked to the downtown area for dinner, and they were all friendly. The hosts themselves were friendly and were quick to respond to any questions or requests. Overall this is a great place to stay, I would highly recommend it if you are looking for somewhere close to the university and/or downtown!"

The parking is behind the building and the lot is a little difficult to maneuver in, but great we had parking.
Be sure to point the shower head towards the wall on your first turn on.
Overall we loved the space, would stay here again, and would recommend it to anyone we know."

Stayed a few nights","A wonderful location, walking distance to everything downtown! The unit was spic'n'span and, despite being a half-basement, was bright and cheery and well-lighted. There were more amenities than I needed in the kitchen, including a bottle of wine. The decor was pleasant and modern, and the furniture was comfortable, including the bed. I have sciatica problems and many beds cause me pain or are unusable. Not here! The bathroom had plenty of towels, shampoo, and body wash as well as a well-lighted mirror. The water pressure in the shower was incredible! I'd kill for that at home! The ""wand"" attachment on the shower head, with it's ultra fine jets, was actually painful, it came out so hard! There was only one glitch for me, and many people may not care about it: the nice, classic, deep tub was a key factor in my choosing this unit; unfortunately, on 3 attempts at different times of night and day, there was never enough hot water to fill it to a practical level. Also, my thrill at the shower's water pressure was dampened (pun intended) by the same issue: the hot water ran out too quickly for me to luxuriate for more than 5 minutes. As I said, this isn't a critical issue for many, and most will probably love this place!"

The only issue is that there is another apartment above and the footsteps are quite noticeable at night.

Stayed a few nights","For visiting the Palouse region as a photographer, I find Moscow very central to the well-known photography locations. I believe we reached Steptoe Butte in under an hour, and a captured some amazing pictures. Comparing Colfax and Pullman, Moscow offers more shopping, restaurants and fitness options. This AirBnB is located only a block or two from the downtown Moscow shops and the Latah Trail. Very nice and well supplied kitchen (most important for us), decent Roku TV with comfortable couch, a sizable and comfortable bedroom, and nice clean bathroom. All very clean. There is some fairly steady noise from above, being an older (remodeled) home. We turned up the TV a bit while there, and with our 33db earplugs had no issues sleeping. Really enjoyed our visit!"

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay. Close to restaurants and the University. Updated and very clean. Owners sent good directions for finding the apartment, but it was a little tricky to find when we arrived in the dark. There is not good sound proofing so we could hear the people above us walking around and their alarm clock in the morning. There are ear plugs provided, which was nice. The shower has great water pressure and water temperatures were good. We used both the bed and the fold out couch. Both were comfortable. The foldout couch has a memory foam topper to help with comfort. Everything was very clean and in nice condition. We are glad we stayed here rather than in a hotel and will plan to return the next time we are in town for a swim meet at the university. Thank you!"

The bed is comfortable, the sofa bed is much more advanced then the typical one (and they even provide a memory foam topper for it!), the water pressure is great, and downtown Moscow is about a block away.

The grocery store is a block away walking distance, it’s got ice cream shops, gift shops, and 5 star restaurants that are right out front! George was amazing! Check in was so easy even at 1 in the morning! He provided visual guidance and written instructions along with a guide book on the best restaurants, what was good there, the walking distance to everything. The shower was high pressured, decor was so artfully satisfying and the staging was comfy. Absolutely heartwarming!"

Comfortable beds, wonderful kitchen, modern bathroom with steaming hot water. Amenities were as described, and the few that were lacking (soap was almost out) were rectified immediately. Awesome owner communication. One note - the room is up two flights of stairs and there is no elevator access, so accessibility may be an issue for some (it was fine for us). Location is right in the middle of town, walking distance to shops, restaurants, theaters, and a VERY nice gaming store (hey, we're gamer geeks... what can I say?). Thanks, George! Your place rocks!"

I'm glad we decided on renting an Air BnB this time and the appartment offered perfection on so many levels: Great location, Classy Chic decor, Delicious coffee, Plentiful kitchen supplies, Nice hot shower, Super Comfy Cozy beds and a Big City appartment feel in the Heart of Moscow. Self Check in was really Simple. Parking was a breeze. Of side notes: You must walk up 2 flights of stairs to get to the appt (which was not an issue for us, we travel light), and, the roadway traffic doesn't offer a completely 'silent' sleep (but it honestly wasn't an issue because the beds were so so comfy). There is coin operating laundry right down the hall that we utilized which was convenient. Overall it was the perfect home away from home. Thank you George! We LOVED your place and hope to return someday!"

Stayed a few nights","This 2 bedroom apartment knocks it out of the park on location and interior decor. Very chic and functional at the same time. You can't beat staying in the heart of downtown Moscow and this apartment is walking distance to everything you want to experience downtown (shopping and food). There are some things to know though. First, traffic is incredibly noisy (Hwy 95 has loud traffic immediately outside the building 24/7) so pack earplugs although closing the windows helps (but not entirely). Second, the apartment is in an old building that is pretty worn to those used to newer, brighter lodging. You have to carry your stuff up several flights of stairs, there isn't an elevator. And lastly, the kitchen is very lightly stocked and there isn't a dishwasher. If you plan to cook much, you might reconsider and just dine out at the great restaurants instead. The apartment is fabulous and I would stay there again in a heartbeat, especially since I figured out as we were departing that it does have air-conditioning.👍😄"

Though our weekend featured some unexpected snow, the apartment is so central that we easily walked to pickup lunch (Humble Burger), dinner (Maialina), and more than one coffee (Bucer and One World). We also ventured to dinner at Sangria Grille, which was terrific and so comforting in the midst of a snowstorm. The apartment is steps from the Saturday farmers’ market, where we scored tamales and apples to enjoy at home. This was our first trip to Moscow and we are eager to return, hopefully to George’s wonderful apartment."

The location is a quick drive to everything in Moscow, but is very quiet. I wasn’t sure I would like sharing a bathroom with the guests across the hall, but it was not an issue. We have stayed in two of the three rentals on site and will be back again!"

I loved the natural soaps, plush towels and bathrobes provided. I also loved the nice comfortable bed. It is quaint and cozy, a perfect place to unwind after a long day to relax. This is what I needed and look forward to staying there next time I am in Moscow. The hosts are also extremely welcoming and kind :)"

Stayed a few nights","100/10! Would absolutely stay here again on my next visit to Moscow. I was so skeptical to stay in a single room in a house (as opposed to an entire house), but honestly was so pleasantly surprised. I wasn’t there much because I was in town for a wedding, but when I was I was totally satisfied! Bed was unbelievably comfortable, shower had an awesome tower with lots of shelving and a mirror, bathroom was extremely clean with lots of extra towels and goodies if you forgot any of the essentials (e.g., toothpaste), there was an extremely soft robe in the room which I absolutely took advantage of, and a desk so I could do some work while I was there. It was truly such a comfortable “nook”. The perfect space for one, maybe 2 people. Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","This house is absolutely lovely and has so many wonderful personal touches. The pictures don't do it justice. The room is quite spacious and all up to date and so nice. They provided everything we could possible need! The fridge was stocked, and there were snacks galore. There was breakfast options and lots of different coffee/tea options as well. The house was super clean and felt new and fresh. Everything was labeled and organized very well. We pretty much had the whole house to ourselves and didn't see the owners at all. There is another room that could have been rented across from ours, and we would have shared a bathroom and that would have been fine as well. It is set up as a perfect little shared guest suite upstairs, and would also be perfect for two couples travelling together. There are robes in the room and a little fireplace. Towels and linens were soft and clean. Everything was just as described and amazing. We will definitely be staying there again as my daughter goes to school at the University. It is a bit across town, but only 8 minutes from campus so not bad at all! The hosts were wonderful and answered any questions that we had promptly. This is a MUCH better alternative to a stuffy hotel room and the price is great!! We saved a lot of money by staying here and we really appreciate the affordable amazing opportunity for us poor college parents!!! :) It was also so much nicer than a hotel as there were so many personal touches that made us feel so welcome and trusted in such a beautiful home. It was also very safe as there were codes both on the front door and on our bedroom door which was really nice. It is in a really nice neighborhood as well. Definitely give this place a try if you are looking for a lovely cozy home to stay at."

The location is perfect, and her suggestions for food or fun are spot on!
I personally, will make this host home my preferred stay whenever visiting Moscow Idaho!
Truly, The Nook is a perfect name for this room. Cozy-cute-and comfy!

I felt very secure during my stay, there are individually coded lockpads on the bedroom doors. I would say that it is probably best to have a car available if staying here, but it's a quick 4 minute drive to the main street so really not a big deal. Thank you Sarah!"

Stayed one night","This is one of the best appointed spaces I have rented on AirBnB. My daughter is a WSU student, and due to family events, she moved to campus alone and I followed weeks later with most of her dorm comforts. We needed a quiet space to watch terrible Netflix and hang out after spending all day setting up and organizing her space, and I wanted a reservation that could be cancelled as ongoing family medical issues meant my trip was less certain than usual, so I decided to trade off proximity to WSU for flexibility. Ultimately I got both -- if you've spent any time in Pullman, you know you're going over to Moscow for supplies, restaurants, etc. So while this is ""a little ways"" from WSU, it's actually very close to much of what you're likely to do during a visit, AND it's a great little hideaway, away from the noise.
The room has ample snacks, a comfortable bed (it's soft -- maybe not ideal if you have a bad back), and every amenity you could want. Coffee, a mini-fridge, a microwave, plush bathrobes for the bathroom (shared with one other rental room), and even a common sitting area. Renting both rooms would be perfect for a college visit with grandparents. There is a flight of stairs, but it's a broad well lit flight, not a ""basement access"" staircase like so many AirBnBs. This is a converted attic, I'd guess, but it's well designed and room AC makes it comfortable.
Sarah was friendly and welcoming, inviting us to join a family event, but also respectful of our desire to spend our time together after a difficult several weeks.
I had no complaints of any kind during our stay -- Sarah has thought of everything. I'm pretty confident if I had needed anything she'd have handled that too. Absolutely would return, potentially for a double-booking with my mom (whose tastes in places to stay are a lot pickier than mine.)"

Stayed a few nights","Sarah and Bryan have put a lot of work into making their AirBnB one of the best around and the work really paid off. The place is very clean and comfortable, with very little noise traveling throughout the house. The location is close enough to the center of Moscow that it is an easy bike ride or walk away, yet secluded enough that there is little traffic going by. The wifi is fast and the air conditioning works quite well, even when it is low 100's outside. The bed is extremely comfortable. Communication was super easy and fast, and I appreciate the door codes so there was no need to have a specific time to meet up to pass off a key or anything like that. Overall, this is one of the best AirBnB's I've stayed at and if I return to Moscow in the future I will be sure to stay here again."

There are so many personal, luxurious touches that make you feel special: The bathrobes, the extra thick towels, the little basket of things you might have forgotten, the snacks. My two nights were blissfully quiet and the bed was like sleeping on a cloud. The kindness of my two hosts and the extra mile they go to making sure you have a memorable, relaxing time, will never be forgotten."

Stayed a few nights","I have zero negative things to say about Sarah as a host or about The Nook! The room and accommodating shared spaces were spotless upon arrival, which made me feel better about traveling during the pandemic. Sarah and her husband were incredibly kind and welcoming, and even went so far as to help get my car out of the snow when we got stuck! There were snacks, fresh linens, extra toiletries, robes (this was my boyfriend’s favorite amenity- he said it was the comfiest robe he’s ever worn!), an accessible Netflix account that required no extra setup, coffee, water, and a binder full of recommendations and information for check-in and checking out. It was well worth the price— I honestly think I would pay even more to stay there! Should I ever find myself in Moscow again, I will definitely be staying with Sarah! I am recommending her and The Nook to every person I know! I could not be more pleased with our experience! Thank you, Sarah!"

The bed is ultra comfy which is what drew me to the place since there where many reviews about it. The sheets where lovely as well. I dread hotel beds and sheets, so I was very happy to find this place.
The kitchen and bath were super clean and contemporary. I appreciated the fact that there was shampoo and body wash provided and lots of clean towels. There was even a cute bottle of fresh creamer in the fridge for those of us who REALLY need our morning coffee. There was tea and spices which is nice if you plan to cook.
Hannah and Marshal were super kind and responsive. I will definitely stay there again."

Stayed a few nights","These hosts are the cream!! Beautiful space, accommodating hosts, farm animals you are allowed to go see and be a part of, and the surroundings are simply stunning. We were invited to join them for a movie in the barn, and a huge bonfire, they shared. fresh chicken eggs with us , and we delighted in wagon rides down their hills. We are big kids at heart and they accommodated all of our inner child tendencies! You will LOVE this place!"

Stayed a few nights","Darling decor, comfy bed, and perfect location for enjoying great restaurants and Saturday’s Farmers market! Parking is included with the rental, which is a wonderful perk. Given Moscow’s vibrant downtown culture, the street noise might be an issue for light sleepers, but we had a great stay"

Stayed a few nights","Great location in downtown Moscow, ID, they had a farmers market on Saturday which was really nice and fun with music. The place was very clean and was just like George described it inside. Only a couple of notes - the hallway wasn't ""nice"", but once inside the apartment, that didn't matter, only 6 hangers, one who likes to hang their clothes like me will find this lacking, and an adorable microwave albeit, extremely small and unable to pop our full bag of popcorn. None of these would prevent me from staying here again, we really liked it!"

Stayed a few nights","Before you read this review , it is coming from a Superhost with 100’s of reviews and critiques…. So with that said, George is a fantastic host!! Very respectful and responsive…and the apartment we stayed in has been completely remodeled and it was amazing compared to the outside surroundings and the walk (entrance ). The biggest AND ONLY issue we had started in the evening when we thought the windows were open… and when unfortunately they were not, we realized the noise was potentially going to be a problem ( the head board is next to the window directly below a very heavily trafficked road) … we would stay in a property hosted by George… just not this one…. Way too noisy for us… however, if you can handle downtime urban living… it might work for you… we need a quieter environment… we were in apartment 143."

Stayed a few nights","The perfect flat you would hope for anywhere in the world! Clean & stylish with privacy and security and just enough comfortable furnishings, spaces and kitchen tools & appliances to making staying in for the night over dinner, or a lingering breakfast, a very doable respite. If you like to be in the heart of a small town's central district this is the place for you. Some street noise, as expected, and the creaks of the renovated older building's floor boards are naturally inherent of this flat's true character but the abundant sunlight through huge windows and plenty of elbow room with it's thoughtful layout make up for all of that wonderfully. Book it now (but leave a spot for us to return! :)"

Stayed a few nights","I really liked the room, really nice and homey. It is in walking distance to great restaurants. I tried to find the parking lot at night. The link to the parking lot was the public parking lot on the other side of the building. I felt like the parking lot was a little hidden. The parking lot is between an old bank and a gray building on 3rd street between Jackson and Main St. it’s across from Wells Fargo’s parking lot.
Had one issue and George got it fixed right away. I was very grateful for that."

Stayed a few nights","The appartement is beautiful, looks just like the pictures. Don’t get discouraged by the slightly less perfect hallway outside, the appartement is really fabulous. I picked it because of the lovely colors and how modern it looked and this place did not disappoint. We had a little bit of trouble finding the parking spot, but George went out if his way to meet us and waved us in to the right spot. How great is that?
I want to be honest and say that even though Moscow is a very small town, it has a lot of traffic. I highly suggest using ear plugs for light sleepers (mine came in handy), but that had nothing to do with the quality of the appartement. Super clean, modern, and coffee and tea supplied which was highly appreciated by my husband and myself. Going to Moscow? Book this place!!"

Appreciated having a private parking spot. The host was very communicative and accommodating, and even allowed us to stay parked in the parking spot for a bit after our checkout to give us time for brunch before a 6-hour drive back home!

The property is in a rather cool historic building, it was so quiet and when you walked into the unit, it was obvious it had been completely redone. We felt very safe while there and the couple times we ran into permanent residents they were nice. The pictures online are EXACTLY how the unit looks which I can appreciate since I've rented other properties that didn't have that exact units pictures, that was not the case here. George was very friendly, ran over a hair dryer for us and helped us figure out parking. I would rent one of his units again and highly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","Great location, beautiful remodel plus caring host makes this location an incredible value - don't hesitate to book! Located in the heart of downtown Moscow, you'll find yourself within short walking distance to all sorts of restaurants, tap rooms, tasting rooms, cafes, delis....We'd recommend Maialina's for Italian and The Breakfast Club for a delicious breakfast out. Dining-in is a great option to take advantage of the new kitchen with convenient center island eating! While the new kitchen has everything you need, the star of the remodel is the beautiful bathroom and walkin shower (great water pressure too). We found the queen bed and pillows very comfortable and the overall unit has plenty of space to relax and unwind. While the overall accommodations are definitely 5-star, we'll note that this unit is off a busy street and does have some road noise. But that being said, you'll find the unit has everyting you need and a host who genuinely cares about your stay! Well done George! Thank you and we'll be back when traveling to Moscow or Pullman (a quick 15ish minutes)."

Otherwise, great stay!"

Her large TV was perfect for watching March Madness basketball.

There were extra pillows and sheets and everything was as described. My kids loved the brand of shampoo-conditioner-body wash in the shower. I think it was called Native. The teenagers sure knew what it was. We called Jessica a couple of times with some local questions. She was both available and informative. We were there attending the 2023 Missions Conference and she knew exactly how to get to the right spots. I would definitely rent the place again. Thanks Jessica!

Stayed a few nights","We had a nice stay here during Parent Weekend. The location was very conveniently close to campus. We really enjoyed the deck and fire table, s’mores were had nightly. The kitchen was stocked very basic with only the bare necessities so it made it hard to cook what we planned for our Vandals and their friends. Overall our stay was great and we had a fabulous weekend with our kiddos. We only had one small issue and the hosts were very quick to respond and had it fixed immediately."

Stayed a few nights","My Daughter came up to Moscow to visit her sister and look at the campus. Micaiah and Eric were very friendly at booking, and the instructions sent before check in were easy to follow. My girls had no issues, the location was great and close to everything. The girls said the beds were very comfortable and the place was ""so cute!"". Thank you so much for hosting them. 💛"
