Stayed with a pet","More than we expected, there were plenty of extras. James is an excellent host, he went over and above to make us feel welcome.
Our family of 5 had more than enough room.
Lots of space outside too, we enjoyed sitting outdoors making smores, roasting hot dogs, etc.
Not to mention the big mouth bass the boys caught in the pond.
Thank you James!!
Blessings to you and yours!!

Stayed with a pet","Everything was fantastic about this Airbnb. The very kind host met me at the cabin when I checked in and gave me a brief tour, explaining the amenities and answering my questions. The log cabin itself is just perfect, so peaceful, so thoughtfully laid out and decorated and all the nice little touches. Every time I came back to this cabin I just felt at peace. The three decks looking out on the back acreage with the stream, the pond, the peaceful trees were just lovely. I came to the area for an event and unfortunately wasn't able to spend as much time in the cabin as I would have liked. This would be a perfect retreat for a writer or someone who needs a time of peace and quiet, because that's what this beautiful cabin retreat provides. I highly recommend this cabin. I want to come back again simply to enjoy the peace and calm of this beautiful little cabin."

We were hauling in for a horse show at WEC Wilmington and James was incredibly flexible on meeting times. He gave a wonderful tour of the home and was thorough and friendly.
We can't recommend this place enough!!"

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed our time at the cabin! The log construction felt right and was what we were looking for. The pond and woods were great for our kids to tromp around. The space had everything we needed (always nice to have a washer and dryer) and was nicely kept. I didn't realize it's close to the road and planes fly low for the nearby airport - but not too often. James was very friendly and gave us a tour at check-in, and even came back the next day to get some firewood out for us to make use of the fire ring. And there were cold York peppermint patties for us in the fridge! Thanks James!"

Stayed with kids","Our family of three had a great time at the cabin. Lots of Positive points: - great host, James was waiting for us and gave a great tour of the property. - there is a farm with fresh produces 2 min away - 5 to 10 min drive to restaurants, gas station, groceries… - comfortable bed - James had firewood and even coffee grounds for us in the freezer - our little one really enjoyed fishing at the pond . Negative: - very close to the road. Actually just off the road and you can hear the cars. It has a neighbor you can see. This is a great place but it is not for someone looking for q cabin very private and tucked in the woods ."

The bathrooms were also very clean, had whatever you may need for the stay, and the one upstairs has a tub for relaxing. This cabin is a short drive to Cowan Lake beach which is also nice. We would definitely stay again in the future!"

Plenty of big bass in the pond and alot of fast blue gill make for fun fishing. The porches are relaxing. Ran out of time to use the fire pit but it is plenty big.

The main bedroom has a bed and pillows that are to die for. We stayed 4 different places on our summer adventure and this was by far the best. We will stay again when we are back in Ohio.

I booked the stay for it’s proximity to Cowan Lake and downtown Wilmington but I could have been totally content to just sit on the back deck/porch the whole weekend and enjoy the peaceful landscape on the property. Jim was very friendly and helpful as well. I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a relaxing getaway."

He keeps the grounds very well maintained and the house was very comfortable and clean. Will definitely be looking to stay there again in the future!!"

There is a ramp on the first floor deck, it’s very scenic, and while close to a moderately busy road I didn’t hear the road traffic at all. The interior was clean and comfortably furnished. The first floor bathroom is large and well decorated, The views from the cabin are great. Very comfortable bed. Cabin had everything we needed to enjoy a great week away from home. The outside sitting areas on the deck behind the cabin are great to bird watch and relax. Slightly over 15 min easy drive to the. Roberts Center. I would love to enjoy this vacation rental again"

Host was very friendly & thorough... met us on arrival for a tour and check in info. Bed was comfortable & we slept great! 5 year old was a little scared to sleep in basement/lower level, so she slept in the couch in living room adjacent to our bedroom just fine. Pond, deck, and outside area great for family time as well as our dog to run around. Some cookware could be updated but we still had what we needed to make nice meals & bake cookies. Perfect time to disconnect and enjoy time together inside a cozy cabin."

The view off the back is all wooded and the deck looking over the yard was a lovely place to read, watch the stars, and have meals.

Stayed a few nights","Jim's cabin is a beautiful spot on 4 acres with everything you could need for a relaxing stay. He met us upon arrival & gave us a helpful tour of the cabin. There's plenty of lounging space on the 3 deck/patio areas with benches, chairs & tables. We loved eating on the little deck off the kitchen. There's a stocked pond out back & up a hill that's great for fishing & even a fire pit & little grill out back. If you plan on walking much I'd bring long pants and closed shoes. We saw deer trails, a great big raccoon, tons of birds, frogs, and a snake hole or two. The bed upstairs was very comfortable. If you're looking to get away from the busyness of life, this is perfect. It's comfortable and has all the basics provided for. There is heat & AC, a full kitchen, washer & dryer, 2 full baths, & an extra dining/game space in the basement with bedroom #2. Wifi and TV are available but it's just too pretty and peaceful to want to spend much time indoors. The cabin is just a few feet away from Route 350 so it's a little noisy with traffic during the day but the sense of space and privacy otherwise more than make up for that. And if you live in town it's still vastly more quiet than you'd be accustomed to. There was very little traffic at night.
We hope to be back! This is our favorite place we've stayed in!"

Kava Haus was a cute coffee spot not too far. Good coffee with must try scones."

Stayed one night","The place was clean aside for stuff in the basement near the washer and dryer which didn’t matter to us bc we only went down there to put the dirty towels next to the washer to make it easier for housekeeping. 2 hours after leaving I received a reimbursement request from the owner asking for $50 extra for housekeeping!!???? Aside from some dishes left in the sink, and a couple tags from a new shirt as well as a bar of soap left in the tub the house was kept very clean. I received pictures from the owner of stuff that was dirty before we entered the premises. I was asked to pay $50 extra for housekeeping (on top of the agreed upon $50 I already paid) for basically something that would have taken 20 mins to clean (about 7 dishes in the sink and a few clothing tags) all in all I am very disappointed with this experience. The house itself was nice and comfortable, but I feel very disrespected and as though someone was trying to take advantage of me. I will not recommend this place to anyon"

Not that my dog chews, but if you had to pick anything up to prevent that, it is minimal. I felt safe being here alone. Parking spot/driveway, is behind the house, just turn into the alley way. Clean walkway to back door. Once I got inside i knew I picked the right one. I brought my own pillows, but the bedding provided is perfect. Tons of closet space. Bathroom towels are so plush, everything was super clean. Kudos to her cleaning person. Coffee maker is Hamilton Flex brew, ground or keurig. She had a few sugars and cream, i went and got my own milk at UD, for my coffee and nightly chocolates she left there JUST FOR ME. lol. This place looks just like the pictures and for sure I will be staying here again. Thank you Tracy, Heidi and Hickory."

The house was SUPER clean and very cozy! I had a great night sleeps and absolutely loved the bedding. The shower was really nice with great water pressure, also super clean. This is a lovely at home feeling place to stay. Highly recommend."

We cooked twice on her stove, but she said we ruined her stove and we have pay for it. it was not broken. It might have some dust on top of it, but I paid cleaning fee. I left everything as it is. Just be careful if you guys planing to stay in this house. Owner might blame you even if you just utilize things she left it for people to use it. Personally i do NOT recommend anyone, unless you want to get blamed for ruining while just using it."

They live in Florida and I live in Pennsylvania so we don't get to see them very often and that area was the most convenient to meet under the circumstances. I am so glad I picked Tracy's house! The price was good, the location was very nice - sweet little town and nice neighborhood - easy drive to Dayton, Columbus or Cincinnati for fun if you want big town stuff, but Wilmington has everything you might need as far as shops and restaurants. The decor and comfort are outstanding. We used the super unique (to me anyway) blow up bed and my grandson thought it was very comfy - it was so easy to put up and take down! The off-street parking is good, too. You can't go wrong with this one."

Clean! Quiet! Great communication with the owners too! And all of the amenities you need.
If you are showing at WEC, it is literally down the street .... one turn and, 1 mile later, you are at WEC! It’s perfect for those long horse show days where you can come back to the house to take a nap, do some work (WiFi works!!), catch up on emails etc. My daughter and I stayed there and, it was perfect.
They also have an opportunity for a ‘connecting area’ to extend the space if you need it. AND, Another small cabin not connected that could also be rented. We did not see the inside of the other two places but, did read they were also available.
We loved it and next time we are in town, if available - we will stay there! 😊"

The craftsmanship in their place was extraordinary. We especially loved the country view and the night stargazing from your private deck is spectacular!
Heath and Trish's space had many options for outdoor seating and lounging with a cool pond feature and fountain. Their entire abode was outstandingly clean and is handled with meticulous detail. Every single thing that we reached for over our weekend stay was there.
Super cool people! My husband and I would highly recommend their place to stay.

If you are in Wilmington for the bar exam: it is worth it to stay here rather than a hotel. Only 15 minutes from the testing center (taking peaceful back roads each morning helped my nerves a bit). Plus, a full kitchen and you get to stay away from the nervous bad energy you’d have with hundreds of others who are at the hotel."

The beds were very comfortable, there was coffee provided, the pool was dreamy and incredibly warm on a cool fall night, the entire place was kept spotlessly, and best of all we felt we had made a new friend before leaving. Wonderful, absolutely wonderful Karan!"

The pool is so relaxing, warm, and inviting. There are plenty of chairs & tables to choose from. When a storm rolled in, I curled up with a book in the pool house- the couch is so comfy!Karen has a speaker at the pool that she’ll cast music to for your enjoyment & the house has a roku TV which I casted music to when I was hanging out at the house.
Cannot say enough about this place! Will definitely be back.

They ONLY potential downside was the location. There’s not a ton going on in the immediate area especially at night. We knew this going in and were looking for nice family weekend trip, and that’s exactly what we had! We will be back for our next family weekend. Cowan lake is very nice and there are some trails at the lake to walk which we enjoyed. If you’re looking for a party town look elsewhere in my opinion."

The two bedrooms were perfect for us and our kids. It’s cozy and has a lovely fireplace. We put together a puzzle that was there, played games we brought, although they have a few available too. We did a mix of eating out and cooking. There is salt and pepper, but you’ll need to bring everything else.
The Barn is super clean and because it was Christmas week, had lots of decorations and the cutest little Christmas tree! We would definitely come back! Karen was great at communicating and check in and out are super easy."

Beds were so comfortable (wife took multiple naps). Shower was great. We loved having the washer/dryer available to us so we could go home with all clean clothes. Kitchen had everything you needed - it was nice to have two grills to pick from - a nice charcoal Weber grill (bring your own charcoal) and an amazing Lynx gas grill by pool area.
Speaking of pool area - that was the most amazing part of the trip. Initially, we were skeptical of hanging out at pool right next to owner’s house - we were wrong. We felt right at home and Karan was so accommodating. Remember - if you need something, message Karan...she responds in minutes and delivers.
Kids didn’t want to leave and we will definitely be back."

Although the barn is on Karan’s property, the barn is a little home unto itself, with the perk of a swimming pool and friendly owners nearby. The barn is decorated so nicely - top notch furnishings and appliances, but at the same time it is welcoming and cozy. It is in the middle of Ohio farm country so the views are lovely, yet Wilmington is close by for a quick trip to Wal-Mart for dinner goodies and a set of pajamas for my friend who forgot to bring hers along! :)"

Stayed a few nights","Having never stayed at an AirBnB we were not sure what to expect but this experience was far better than anything we imagined! The barn was beautiful, so cozy and very nicely kept with thoughtful touches that made us feel very welcome. The property overall is such a gem, secluded and quiet, our girls loved the tree house, swing set and the tire swings! The pool area makes you feel like you are at a resort, it is so beautiful, but you still feel at home at the same time. Karan & Steve give you plenty of privacy but we found ourselves hoping to see them because they are a delight to talk to. Our whole family got so excited every time Nibbles & Wilson came running out, such sweet dogs! This was the perfect quiet and relaxing escape from the craziness of 2020!"

Stayed with kids",Karans place was absolutely amazing. The location was perfect for a weekend getaway! The barn was so cute and stylish! Karan was quick to respond for any of our needs. The pool and all the extras was amazing. The first night we had the pool to ourselves and the second night we shared with the girls renting the other rental but they were super friendly so it wasn't a big deal. They also had the cutest playhouse. We will definitely be back to visit!! ❤

Stayed with kids","My family and I spent a week here and had a great time. My children loved having access to a pool and absolutely loved that it ""glowed"" at night. We did spend a couple of day trips going to Columbus which was only about an hour away. We also did some nearby outlet shopping and could have gone to an amusement park but the kids had fun at the pool so we skipped the amusement park this trip. Karan and Steve were so nice to talk with. They were always available if we had questions but gave us space to enjoy the property. Their dog, Nibbles was great to have around as well. My oldest was very sad to leave Nibbles behind. We loved having him around. Thank you so much Karan and Steve."

Wasn’t a big deal for us since the other couple was nice. We did a lot of cooking in the kitchen, had to get creative for a few things, but otherwise it had most things we needed. When there are Frontgate towels in the bathroom - you know it’s a nice place ;)"

For two people who have back issues the beds were outstanding. We were both able to get good sleep each night which makes any trip that much better. I am not sure if I will ever be back in Wilmington but if I am I hope to be able to stay at Trail M again. Thank you very much to our host for making such a wonderful place to stay and enhancing our trip.

The home sits on beautiful land with horses fenced in right behind the house. It is a quiet location and it couldn’t get any better for a perfect relaxing trip. Colleen is so easy to talk with and responds quickly. She is very friendly and kind and went out of her way for our family to spend time together. Our family will have these great memories to cherish for always and we truly couldn’t be more grateful. Thank you to Coleen and family.
We will definitely come back to this Airbnb location again and again.

I will note, This property is a duplex and someone will be right next door, separated by an interior hallway.

Both times we have gone there has been foals recently born. If you are looking for a weekend getaway close to home or have an equine lover who needs their horse fix, this is the place! There is a pond and a decent size creek onsite for fishing. They are also located close to Cowan Lake and Caesars Creek."

Stayed a few nights","The house is nicely situated on an ex-racing horse farm and is very quiet with beautiful views of the fields and horses. Everything in the home was very functional, comfortable and easy to operate. So thankful that dogs were allowed as we were in town for a series of dog shows at the conveniently nearby Robert's Center. At the house there were lovely areas to walk the dogs and relax. The nearest grocery store is very fast and easy to get to in Wilmington. Colleen was a wonderful host...great communications and easy check-in and it was a great stay in every sense of the word. I only wish we could have stayed longer or had some shorter days at the shows as it would have been wonderful to sit on the deck overlooking the horses in the fields and had a glass of wine. Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","To start, the communication from Colleen beginning with the reservation all the way through check out was spot on and exactly the right amount. We chose this location based upon a few factors, first it's full home experience, including the fact that it had two bedrooms with queen size beds each with its own bath was perfect for my family. Secondly we were competing at WEC and it is just a couple minutes to get there and back making it extremely convenient and when you combine that with the serene country horse farm setting and the cleanliness of the home it was a joy to come back and relax, spend time with the family and get ready for the next day of competition. This will be the first place that we look to book again on our next trip to WEC. Priced right, extremely clean, great location, phenomenal host, you couldn't ask for more if you're going to be staying in Wilmington. Thank you again Colleen!"

It was lovely being able to have coffee, breakfast and watch the horses cross the pasture behind the house. I understand that there are three other guest house spaces on premise. We would happily stay again.
For the horse show group -- this place is about as far to the south as the WEC is to the west so very convenient."
