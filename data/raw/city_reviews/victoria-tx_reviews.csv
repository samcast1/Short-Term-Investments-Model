Stayed one night","My partner and I were in town for a paddling race on the San Antonio River. This was the perfect getaway to unwind after the race! Very close to downtown, so we could pop in for dinner or snacks at the gas station, but far enough to have a peaceful morning with birdsong! We would stay here again in the future :)"

Richard and his dogs are so friendly and we felt welcome in the very first minute.
A clean apartment with all you need.
Sadly we were just staying for one night. I really would’ve loved to stay longer. But sadly our vacation has to end sometime.
Richard, God bless you and your family."

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay. We were looking for a quiet place and found it. Richard's place was great. There are amenities on site I've not seen before for a small Airbnb (pool and gym). The owners live on site - the Airbnb is above their garage attached to the house, so not the most private location, but it wasn't an issue for us. They had two sweet, vocal dogs who greeted us one afternoon, and a cat watching from afar. Overall, we liked our remote Goliad weekend getaway!"

We enjoyed the inside and outside, including the dogs and seeing the chickens, and walking the property. We enjoyed the balcony for star gazing and for the solar eclipse that happened while we were there. The kitchen was equipped for our needs. Would definitely go there again.

Stayed one night","We booked this little garage apartment for its solitude & privacy over a hotel in town. Richard’s place is quiet, clean, private and far more cost effective than staying in town.
I took a dip in the pool after my coffee and then we got to meet Richard as he walked his property feeding his animals. He was so friend and gave us 5 fresh eggs for breakfast. Yum!
Wish we could’ve stayed longer but this was a quick trip. We’ll definitely be back since we have friends just down the road.
Thanks for the hospitality Richard! Many blessings.😊"

Stayed with a pet","The place was very wonderful and clean and cool! (the last isn't always a given in the middle of Texas!)
Richard was absolutely wonderful and very flexible. I had been in the area because my grandmother had passed away, so was more than a little frazzled, and had to do some major last minute rescheduling because of all that. Richard was very understanding and kind the entire way, got me a refund for the days I didn't end up spending there, and that was it.
The eggs are real and delicious, and the dogs he has are in fact friendly, although they will run up to you. Let them sniff you a bit and it'll be all good. I mention only in case somebody else is like me and a bit nervous around dogs. :)
Definitely recommend."

Stayed a few nights","My boyfriend , Josh, and I cannot say enough wonderful things about the hospitality of Richard and his dogs Thor and Mel. I’m from Goliad, I said I would never move back, yet staying here made me immediately reconsider. Richard instantly reminded me of the down-home friendliness this community has. Since it’s been a while since I’ve ventured about town, he offered the perfect dining suggestion (La Terrazza) for my boyfriend and my parents to break bread together.
Greeted by the friendliest dogs you’ll ever meet, don’t let the initial light growls scare you. They are puppies in big dog suits. The bright and open space within the garage apartment makes it feel like you’re sleeping under the stars. Believe me, I found myself lost staring up through the large windows of the A frame space. The fresh eggs left by Richard were the perfect inspiration that lead my boyfriend to treat me to a midnight dish of steak and eggs - consumed, of course, under those beautiful stars. Perfection!"

All is well furnished...we had the choice of 3 different kinds of coffee pots! Everything we needed was provided even paper cups for teeth brushing. The balcony was the place for incredible star gazing. Richard was a gracious host who made us feel at home. I wish this place was closer as I would spend time in the pool relaxing and enjoying nature."

There is a well maintained above ground pool and exercise equipment you’re welcome to use. We particularly appreciate the lack of light pollution and enjoyed sitting out on the balcony porch later in the evening. We do not have small children, but many safety precautions are put in place in case you’re traveling with some."

Stayed one night","While the home and land were beautiful there were some serious issues we had. I feel like if a renter says they'll be in late, you should turn on some lights to see especially when it's women traveling alone and its as dark as it is. I also feel like, if I've messaged you immediately after booking about you should message back at least to let me know you won't be there or that you got the message. Check-In directions weren't very clear and the communication could have been much better. I can say that once he did message back he was very nice but the communication was lacking, especially compared to the last two times I used AirBnB and the owners were amazingly communicative. Other issues were that the dogs were barking at 6am and woke us up and since we got in so late it would've been nice to sleep later than 6. Then when I went outside in the morning the black dog was snarling, growling, and biting and lunging at me and while I understand that dogs are protective of their food, if you have a dog that behaves in this manner, they shouldn't be allowed out where paying guests can come across them. Thankfully, I've been around dogs my entire life and knew to stop moving, avoid eye contact, and back away but I was TERRIFIED of being attacked, especially since I was out there alone for no one to help. I ended up walking around the garage and approaching the door from behind so that I could get back in without crossing in front of the dog. There was also nothing at the end of the driveway to make it easier to spot the driveway in the dark. Reflectors and a solar powered landscape light would go a long way in helping renters find this place in the dark bc it's BLACK out there where it's so far out. Again, the home was beautiful and extremely clean but the experience wasn't as pleasant as we'd hoped. I honestly would LOVE to come back with spouse because I know he'd love this place but I'd like to see these changes take place before doing so and then I'd be more than happy to leave a 5 star review. For anyone reading this review, while my star rating is not high, I can say that if you like the way this place looks and really want to stay, reach out to the owner to see if these changes have been made bc if so, I think you'd really love it. Also, remember Texas is summer is swelteringly hot. We live in Louisiana so we're used to it but people who aren't from the south aren't and it's tough. I hope that this review helps effect the changes that are needed to make this place go from OK to GREAT bc it's potential is definitely great."

He easily accommodated adding a second night to our stay. The internet/tv connection was slow but i think that’s to be expected out in the country. The farm fresh eggs were a lovely touch!

Stayed one night","Whoa, absolutely PERFECT. Blown away at what a value this was, what you don't get in ""being around amenities"" i.e. near bigger cities"", you more than make up in scenery and accommodations. if I were a Batchelor, I would have really enjoyed renting the guesthouse on a longer term basis. very clean, felt very secure, excellent privacy. I wanted to explore the grounds and see what else was around the property but didn't want to bug anyone, even though the Hosts seemed very accommodating to requests. one of the highest recommendations I would give, absolutely no complaints. I made sure to clean up after myself, it's not a place you would feel good about leaving messy.
thank you for hosting, the level of Care and consideration you show are reflected in the rental. to whomever is reading this, you are making a HUGE mistake if you stay at a hotel over this gem!"

Do keep in mind there are stairs to climb, but if you need to stay in the area or go to the close by Goliad State Park, don't hesitate to stay here in this quiet country place. If Richard isn't around, his friendly pups will be more than glad to give you a welcome!"

He’s a very gracious host and the place is immaculate.
His welcome committee of canines make you feel relaxed and at home. The privacy is great and going for walks is also serene.
Easily accessible and less than 15 minutes to Goliad.
I highly recommend if you’re in the area.
(*Stairs to loft may be an issue for mobility if climbing is a challenge.)"

The property is amazing, with beautiful, mature live oaks, and the guest house was very comfortable, clean, and had everything we needed. We will be staying here again in the future."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I LOVED our stay with Sherre!! This was my first time staying at an AirBnB where the host shared the house, but Sherre made us feel so comfortable and welcome in her home. She works in-person most of the day and respects your privacy when she's home. We cooked, made coffee, used her fridge, etc. whenever needed. She has a beautiful front and backyard with a cute patio and butterflies everywhere. Felt like a dream.
Her dog, Latte, is very sweet, hypo-allergenic, and is not allowed in the guest room. If he stayed home while Sherre was at work, he quietly napped in her room the whole day so my husband was able to work online without worry of a dog barking.
Check-in was smooth, even though she wasn't home when we came. She set the code on the door to our preference and has a front door camera for security. Sherre has masks and hand sanitizer at the door if you choose to use them because of Covid. She ensures that her home is kept clean and fresh for her guests' comfort and I know that if a Covid situation arose, she would act accordingly to ensure your safety.
Easily the BEST AirBnB we've stayed at!!"

Group trip","Jocelyn's place was just right for a getaway for my husband and I to see parts of Texas closer to our home in Austin. We love the fact that someone takes an old house, renovates it or buys it, preserves it and puts in the time, expense, effort to keep it up, and shares with others like us.
A favorite part: The verandah through the upstairs bathroom.
As with old houses, there are always small things; Jocelyn was wonderful and quick to respond. If planning on cooking much, do speak to Jocelyn because you may need extra pots. We ate at wonderful local restaurants: Noot's Thai place is incredible, freshly made food that we haven't found elsewhere and a lovely owner; PumpHouse is likely considered the fanciest restaurant in town and lovely on the banks of the Guadalupe; Mi Ranchito is very small breakfast place that has incredible tortillas, seemingly freshly made like in Mexico; Ramsey's takes you back decades with down home food. The beach is under an hour away. Overall, a great base!"

Group trip","This house was awesome! It's very spacious and clean. The hotels that we've stayed at in Victoria are in a similar price range to this house, but the value you get from staying here is not even close. The upstairs rooms are so big and comfortable and all of the restrooms are very clean and nice. From now on when my family comes to Victoria, we're going to book here!
Jocelyn was very accomadating and responsive. She was super nice and pleasant to work with.
Thanks Jocelyn!"

There were even Christmas dinner ware to use. We most definitely will book again if given the opportunity. Very responsive hostess. Truly enjoyed the stay. The house was just as described.

When I booked, I had no idea there was a Christmas tree lighting and parade in easy walking distance, so it was our own little Hallmark Christmas!
I've stayed in quite a few Airbnb and VRBOs, and I'll just tell you, these were the most comfy beds ever! We all slept like babies!
Jocelyn was the perfect hostess. She made sure our little Christmas was set up for success, and she even provided a little tree for us to decorate with our grandson.
We definitely will be coming back! I highly recommend this house!"

Stayed with kids","Staying at the 19th hole was a great experience! Our family traveled over six hours to get to Victoria, so it was nice to walk into a rental that was not only clean but well designed. The only issue we had when we got there is that the thermostat was set to 85 and the inside of the house was very close to that since it's May in Texas. We quickly figured out how to use the thermostat with the help of Erin and it cooled down rather quickly.
Our daughter loved having a house with stairs because it's not something she's used to. We brought a bag of our own toys to keep her entertained but were delighted to find that they had additional toys for her to play with.
My husband is a golfer so the location was fantastic for him and he got a round in while we stayed. We would highly recommend this rental to anyone needing to stay in Victoria, we'll be sure to book again if we happen to be in the neighborhood.
Special thanks to Erin for creating such a great space!"

Some played a round of golf there and others sat on the back patio talking late into the night. The kitchen had all the things needed to feel like cooking, and we did. The bath rooms had all the things needed that you might forget to bring. Very nice and inviting. It was just perfect for our stay and visit. We were celebrating my brother's 70th birthday and it was such a nice surprise to see the Happy Birthday plates, napkins, and banner that were on the table when we arrived. (Thank You) We all agreed and kept saying how much we loved staying there. We would definitely stay again.
Thank you, loved it!"

There was a nice empty garage too that was nice to park our car and our golf cart in. The washer and dryer also came in handy and we made use of the grill on the patio for dinner. I can't speak for all of the beds, but the king size bed was incredibly comfortable!!

Our girls loved the kid rooms and loved that they had their own bathroom attached to their room. The beds were all comfortable, there were plenty of extra towels, and they were higher quality than what I typically see when I have stayed at other AirBNBs. The bathrooms were well stocked with toilet paper, and the kitchen had plenty of paper towels and trash bags. The instructions for check in and check our were clear and concise, the check out was the easiest of any AirBNB I have stayed at which was appreciated. We will be back anytime we are traveling with the family to Victoria. I highly recommend this property."

The hosts were very responsive for the few questions we had. They had left food for us to feed the animals with (labeled, which is very helpful!), which our son loved. My wife loved the farm eggs they had left for us in the fridge. Very thoughtful (and tasty)!
It was exactly what we were looking for: a nice, cozy place out in the quiet country where we could go and rest. We'd love to go back the next time we need to unplug!"

there is a cabin next door, but you can't see them at all from your porch. it feels very private. I was hesitant to book initially for that reason, but i still felt like I was alone out there."

Group trip","We couldn’t have asked for a better location, as we were in the area for an event at Schroeder Hall and Stephanie’s tiny home is just minutes away. That being said, we wished we’d planned to spend another day or two to relax and unwind in a peaceful, quiet setting; the stargazing was an unexpected perk. The accommodations were a bit tight for the six of us (it is a “tiny home” after all, and we knew that when we booked so we planned accordingly), mainly due to our two lively youngsters, but the beds were so comfy and Stephanie had provided everything we could have possibly needed and then some, plus we loved being out in the country! The kids were really excited to sleep in the lofts. We’d definitely stay here again when in the area."

Stayed with a pet","I stayed at this charming Airbnb for a family Christmas getaway, and it was truly a delightful experience. Nestled in the midst of a serene ranch, the small house we chose was a perfect escape.
The highlight was the opportunity to interact with the resident cows. We were provided with food to feed them, making it a unique and enjoyable experience for our entire family.
The presence of a friendly dog and catfish-filled pond added to the overall charm. Our love for animals was well catered to, creating a peaceful and joyful atmosphere throughout our stay.
What made our experience truly exceptional were the extra special touches from the hosts. It was evident that the hosts went above and beyond to ensure our time there was truly special.
For my animal-loving mom, this getaway was a perfect gift. The blend of nature, animals, and thoughtful gestures from the hosts created a unique and heartwarming Christmas celebration. I highly recommend this Airbnb."

They ran free in nature, sat around the fire and hung out with the cows,
so peaceful and quiet and away from it all, exactly the experience I wanted for my children and I .
The tiny home was immaculate with plenty of cozy space for me and my six kids, everyone had a great time!
Thank you so much for the opportunity !"

Stayed a few nights","They had a cute little tiny house to stay in. It was even supplied with eggs and had some outdoor cooking supplies and a fire pit to enjoy the outdoors with, along with a picnic table. We enjoyed the cows and a white dog we named Ghost who would pay us a visit. The first morning there we witnessed and encounter with one of the calves with some visiting deer. It wasn't our destination but a stopping place we wanted to try out. Do keep in mind, this is a tiny house and the loft only allowed for sitting up in the middle of the loft due to the slopping roof line, but there was a lot of space up there otherwise. We enjoyed the quiet and seeing the stars at night. I could even faintly see the Milky Way, which I haven't seen in awhile. This place could be a quiet get away to unwind from a very busy life and recharge."

From the beautiful setup, the thought process of all the little details and they have everything you could need for your stay! A tiny home that’s not so tiny! Slept us all comfortably and enjoyed cooking the farm fresh eggs in the pretty good sized kitchen! I recommend this to ANYONE who wants to indulge in nature by feeding the cows, going to feed the catfish and see the awesome scenery! Thanks again you guys! We will be back, again and again!
Also, perfect weather right now for a fire and s’mores and gazing at the stars. Loved it!"

Upon stepping inside, we were greeted by a warm and inviting ambiance, beautifully decorated interiors, adorable notes throughout the house, and all the amenities one could wish for. They even included fresh lemonade and farm eggs.
Our host, Tracy, went above and beyond to ensure our stay was nothing short of exceptional. Their hospitality truly exceeded our expectations.
The highlight of our stay was undoubtedly the backyard, where we spent an evening savoring the tranquil area, enjoyed great BBQ, and watched the kids play in the pool.

Stayed with kids","Tracy and Paul provided an exceptional weekend for my children, myself, and my girlfriend. The property is spacious and meticulously designed to cater to guests of all ages. The rooms are beautifully crafted in a pine trim that offers a “country elegance” to its accommodating space. The rooms are carefully themed, encouraging and challenging the imagination of its younger guests with toys, books, instruments and decor designed to educate and elate the kiddos. It’s exceptionally clean, very well kept, and we especially enjoyed the thoughtful touches of home made lotions, sumptuous lemonade, and country fresh eggs. To top it all off, Tracy went out of her way to help me surprise my girlfriend by picking up and delivering a beautiful birthday cake. Her hand written notes were ever thoughtful. This was a weekend filled with magical moments that will stretch into the eternity of our lives with its bountiful and beautiful memories. It’s absolutely a Texas treasure in more ways than one. 5 ⭐️"

Stayed with a pet","Highly recommend!
Let me start of by saying that my family and I have never used AirBnb before this stay and we were nervous how everything worked etc.
Tracy was immediately communicative right after I made the reservation by letting me know a few extra details.
The night before our stay, Tracy messaged me letting me know everything about the property, how to gain access, the rules, what’s expected upon leaving and even places we would enjoy visiting or dining.
I appreciated the prompt responses from Tracy, as well as her genuine friendliness.
The home is beautiful and there’s plenty of space for adults, as well as children. The pool is very well kept and relaxing with the deck right next to it. The hosts also leave coffee pods and teas, and farm fresh eggs.
If we are ever in the area again, I will definitely look Tracy and her husband up again for another stay!"

Stayed with a pet","Tracy is an excellent hostess, and her beautiful home exceeded my expectations. Really appreciate the extra welcoming touches found throughout the home: brownies, fresh lemonade and snacks, farm fresh eggs, etc. My friend and I also purchased delicious ribeye steaks from her farm. If I ever need lodgings again in the Victoria area, I will definitely be returning. Highly recommend!!!!"

We were there to celebrate a birthday, and staying there was more than we could ask for. Every room was design for comfort. Her kitchen was spacious and had everything we needed to cook. The back covered patio was very relaxing and the view of the backyard was awesome."

It was so very clean & very comfortable. The master bed was the most comfortable bed we ever slept on with Airbnb. Showers were nice .
Kitchen had everything we needed.
Especially enjoyed the back deck when we got a surprise rain shower.
We had a small gathering of relatives to celebrate dad’s 90th birthday & it was just perfect. Of course, we got permission first & Tracy was very accommodating.
Tracy is the BEST host. Always quick to respond to me. She is also a new friend of mine!❤️ I highly recommend this place & we will be back."

Group trip","OMG!!! This place was so great for our family. Probably the best/favorite Airbnb for our family ever. Attention to detail. Many custom items in each room. The Fish tank I could watch for hours. Many fast breakfast items and 2 coffee pots, one pod based and one traditional. The Home is perfectly done. Not too busy but appointed appropriately for your stay. Quick Grab and go breakfast items were a nice touch. Only wish we had more time to stay and enjoy the property to its fullest. The back porch was amazing with a view of the river below. We enjoyed coffee in the setting area. All the family said we need a return visit just to stay back at the house. The beds are to die for. Best night sleep in years. Master suite has a jacuzzi soaking tub that we did not get to use but it included several scented bath salts to choose from. Both showers are custom ""Rain"" shower, a really cool feature. The grounds are overly than expected landscaped."

The home is full of lots of accommodating details like bath salts for the bath, toys for kiddos, plenty of condiments and seasonings in the kitchen to cook with, lots of places to sit while relaxing on the back porch or in the living room. The beds are very comfortable and everything is super clean. We only got to enjoy the one night but definitely excited to come back with more of the family as this is a very large house.

Stayed with kids","Tracy and Paul offer a truly amazing home nestled in a quiet and peaceful area just outside of the city but sill close enough to everything you need. We were in town for our son’s wedding and this accommodated our family of ten comfortably. With the abundant amount of space we never felt like we were overcrowded and from the way the house is designed, it provides plenty of quiet and relaxing privacy in each bedroom despite any boisterous behavior in the common areas. The master suite is huge and its walk-in closet can host a crib or playpen and in our case, two rambunctious nieces. Plus, the garden tub is a nice luxury that helps to relax and unwind after a long day. We found the best amenities to be the 1) porch, where you are sure to enjoy the calm of the early morning and evenings and maybe get some glimpses of deer and the 2) salt water aquarium which is a sight to behold, but don’t be fooled by its sense of serenity during the day and early evening, because when the lights go out, chaos ensues when more fish appear from behind the living coral and the crabs come out of their shells. Staying at this home will not leave you disappointed and to top it off, Tracy is a very understanding person and was always available and quick to respond at any time."

Stayed a few nights","We loved staying at Tracy's home and it is hard to leave such an amazing home. The street that is is located is quiet and private with beautiful homes and well kept yards. My cousin loved having his coffee in the morning on the back porch. Inside the home, we had everything we needed and then some. Things I hadn't even thought of needing were available for our use. Every Airbnb I've stayed in has been clean, but Tracy's place is sparkling clean and spotless. Hard work and lots of love must go into keeping this place so beautiful inside and out. Every room was very roomy and comfortable as well as tastefully furnished. There is plenty of room to spread out. We loved the layout of the home. I could not have chosen a better place to stay. This airbnb is definitely a home away from home. I was at a loss for words, especially when you are provided farm fresh eggs, homemade lemonade and other snacks and treats for you to enjoy, I mean, who does that? Everything you need at your home was pretty much there for you. This place exceeds 5 stars. The photos do it no justice, its way better in person. Believe me, you'll want to stay here. I wished I could take this house with me! if you like privacy and quiet retreat, this is your place! Thank you so much Delgado Family for sharing your beautiful home."

The biggest bonus is the Texas sized hospitality of the host, Tracy. If you are looking to stay within 60 miles of this rental, you will not be sorry choosing it."

I felt completely at ease with my children there, we did not feel a burden. I am a fellow homeschooler, and really appreciated the educational toys she offered. Tracy had everything from science kits, to puppet shows. We had a blast. The girls didn’t want to leave, nor did I. It’s a home and you truly feel the love. It’s filled to the brim, I really enjoyed the energy and am so blessed to have found the Delgado residence. Thanks again, Tracy. You’re a true hostess, and have a beautiful gift!"

Stayed with kids","First off, I just want to say that I have never had a host like Tracy. She was quite possibly the nicest person I have ever met. It started when she asked me if I would like to purchase steaks from her farm. We love grass fed everything and I said yes with a lot of enthusiasm. She texted me and asked if I would like her to marinade them for me. That's when I knew this was someone super special. I couldn't believe it when I got to the house there was food in the kitchen for us, snacks and treats for our kids, even valentines themed cookies and candy. To get to the house tired from our two hour trip and not have to run to the grocery store right away was simply amazing. She even left us fresh eggs from their farm, I mean, does it get any better? And it was all there for us for free, no extra charge. She was so incredibly attentive and gave me instructions on how to cook the steaks just right. (THEY WERE SO AMAZING). I could go on for pages on how amazing she treated us, I felt like we got celebrity treatment. The house itself was incredibly beautiful and so comfortable. My kids felt right at home. The mattress on the beds were AMAZING! I need to ask her what kind she uses bc I want one for my house. I felt sad leaving her house bc I had never been treated so well. Tracy is beyond a wonderful host, she is a wonderful person and I would go out of my way to stay anywhere she is the host."

We were in town for a funeral over there weekend and my cousin had tragically lost her 16 year old son. She was wanting a plant because she said during all this, she hasn’t got one. When we got to the Delgado house, there were flowers AND A PLANT! The Lord worked through the Delgado’s to care for us. Thanks! Thanks! Thanks! We will always remember the Skip Bo, Breaking out the telescope; mom cooking for all of us! All the details were perfect! Included every amenity and FELT LIKE HOME!

This was my second stay of 2021. I will stay here every time I come to visit in the future. House and property are immaculate. Pantry and kitchen are well stocked with essentials, cereal, and snacks. Showers and tub are spa like. Salt water tank 🐠 and wooden puzzles are a huge plus. Large sofa for movie night and large kitchen and dining room table for gathering to share in meals with your friends and family.
Tracy is a perfect host and goes above and beyond in providing essentials. She is also trustworthy, my son left his wallet with cash at the house. She texted us before we noticed it was missing. She went out of her way to drop it off with my dad. Absolute integrity and a super star! 🌟"

After spending the afternoon at the beach we had an easy drive into the city, picked up seafood at one of Tracy’s recommended restaurants and had a delicious dinner overlooking her beautiful property. Our dogs were in heaven running around in the huge, well kept, fenced backyard. The house has so many beautiful touches that showed she really cared about her guests. She provided homemade jam, homemade bath salts to go with a gorgeous tub to soak, fully stocked kitchen with fresh eggs and extra snacks, board games, enormous and gorgeously furnished deck, and so many more small, thoughtful details. We felt comfortable our entire stay. And finally, Tracy communicated with us quickly and easily, making us feel she was just a quick message away should we need anything (which we didn’t). Thank you so much for sharing your home with us. We will definitely be back soon!"

Stayed with kids","WOW. This property was everything it represented itself to be, and so much more! Communication was exceptional! Tracy let us know about many of the ""staple items"" that would be present in the home. However, the amenities and thoughtfulness of provisions FAR EXCEEDED our expectations, even our hopes.
Pots overflowing with succulents and plants are scattered everywhere in front of and inside the home. Fresh flowers and fragrance from wax warmers greeted us. In the kitchen, we found a basket of dry goods (raisins, applesauce, oatmeal, granola bars), in the freezer a loaf of bread, in the fridge fresh farm eggs. USB hubs all over. We were traveling with four children, aged 2-8. The kids loved the airplane room, so many toys, baskets of activities, chalk... everything they wanted and more was there for them to enjoy. We found a booster seat in the garage, travel games, board games, kinetic sand, cards, dominoes, sensory toys, a craft box... it was amazing. The decor and accents are staged in such a way that everything was either out of reach for the kids or totally fair game and safe. As a parent, that provided a space to truly relax.
The kitchen is so well appointed it's almost too good to really be able to convey. Everything we reached for we found, from coffee filters and extra Kcups to baking sheets and muffin tins. The cast iron selection and multiple sets of dishes were so nice; we even found plastic dishes for the kids and disposable flatware in the cupboard. The pantry boasted a TON of standard spices as well as dry goods (rice, beans, frosted mini wheats, and lucky charms), and beside the stove we found the homemade spice blends.
The SPACE in this house is unreal. So much room to gather all together or scatter into small groups. The kids were loud and rowdy and we still were able to enjoy peaceful separation in the living room. The showers are large and boasted stone floors and all toiletries. Even the outside is so spacious and comfortable! The property is at the end of a street with a huge front, side, and back yard. The porch view is so peaceful, and the cicadas and birds sang out the whole time. It was lovely porch sitting.
I can't wait to escape to this property again. We had kicked around the idea of a river day or maybe even driving into Port Lavaca for a beach day. But the home was so inviting and comfortable, we decided to just stay in and enjoy an intimate and low-key weekend together. It truly felt like an escape at this comfy hideaway!"

Stayed with a pet","The house was older and not clean. We contacted Airbnb and we have pictures of how unclean the house was. There were stains on every wall, even on the ceiling. Huge mold stain on the ceiling in the bathroom the floor in the bathrooms, especially in the corners was awful. The flooring in much of the house was very old and tattered. We got the house because of the fenced in backyard, the entire side of one part of the backyard was completely unfenced. The neighbors dogs routinely jump over their low fence and scared my kids to death. If after 6pm you could not go outside without the neighbors dogs running at you and barking loudly. All of the white towels had rust stains on them . The walls had markings on them and the whole place was just generally grungy. We have pictures of all this and sent them to airbnb.
The beds were comfortable and the linen was not dirty. The tv was nice and had Netflix. The washer and dryer worked well."

Stayed with a pet","Admittedly, we started off on the wrong foot by arriving to a backyard that had not been cleaned up after the previous guests. The patio dining table had crusted food on it, and there was food thrown in the front and back yards that was not picked up. We immediately notified Carlos, and he came out to clean up.
We could not tell if the inside had been cleaned and sanitized. The rugs in the living room were grimey and stained and desperately need to be replaced or deep cleaned. The shower curtain rod was covered in rust and also needs to be replaced. I could not tell if the base of the toilets had ever been cleaned, but they looked to be covered in dirt/grime. There also appeared to be black mold on the ceiling in the bathroom. Smaller issues we ran into were not having any kitchen towels or kitchen cleaner to be able to wipe down the counters and sticky empty bottles next to the stove.

The neighborhood was nice and quiet, and the mattress in the large room was comfortable."

It’s so clean and everything is put away, it’s child proof basically. The backyard has a grill which was perfect for us after a long day at the beach. You’re only 5 miles from the heb which was also perfect!"

Group trip","Positives-
-Great price
-Kitchen was basically fully stocked with everything you would need except for food!
-Made cooking during our stay very easy.
-No crazy check out rules like other AirBnBs I've stayed at.
Negatives-
-Beds were pretty firm
- The bathroom with the shower in it needs a little maintenance. Its a little out- dated.
All things considered, I would gladly stay here again."

Stayed with kids","House was just like in the pictures. Neat and organized. The only issue we had was there was dust all over the house and floors.
The comforter and bed sheets were dusty, and being a family with seasonal/dust allergies...well not a good nights rest needless to say.
In all fairness, Carlos was a very helpful host with excellent communication who allowed us to check out an hour late as despite our allergies, we overslept.
The City of Victoria had just gotten over days of being without power or water and Carlos was quick to inform us before we made the expense of traveling to give us the option to cancel. We did, but power and water came back on and when I called Carlos he quickly arranged it to where I could book again which is why I would recommend the place if you ever stay in Victoria. I am sure the dustiness of the place had to do more with the weather crisis than anything else."

Good amount of space for the toddler to run around. If you plan on creating big meals, the kitchen supplies is bare minimum so I'm glad I packed my cooking supplies like my 12 inch skillet, sharp knives, mixing bowls & aluminium foil."

We loved the details and effort that went into the window treatments. Beautiful bedding but again you can't tell by the pictures. Loved the Roku TV's in the living and the bedroom. Loved that we had Netflix. The home was cozy warm and inviting. Spacious entertaining area in dining and kitchen. The backyard was huge and enjoyed sitting outdoors. The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed for cooking (pots, pans, etc). The neighbors were friendly. I will definitely want to stay here again..."

Stayed with a pet",The house could have used a lot more cleaning. Refrigerator and microwave were dirty. Half used food still in fridge. The floors were extremely sticky. I mopped 3 times with just water and it didn’t seem to help. There was something sticky on the end table in the living room. Cobwebs all over light fixtures and in between the blinds and windows. The living room area rug smelled awful of pee. The bathroom towel holders kept falling off the wall. They are not installed properly. The landscaping needed some upkeep. There are trees growing thru the deck. They did have lawn service come when we were there but they didn’t so any kind of trimming. Just a mow. On the positive side. The bed was very nice. They provided plenty of towels and extra bed sheets. And they were all nice quality. They also had a large supply of cleaning products which was nice since we stayed 9 days. The neighborhood is very quiet. We didn’t hear a peep from any of the neighbors. The only big downfall for this location is the school that is only about 3 houses down… from 10am until 2pm it’s non stop screaming. If your looking for a quiet location this is NOT it. The school isn’t even mentioned in the listing… people should know it’s not going to be quiet during the day. I think for the price of this house one could expect much more. They do have nice appliances and they had a little drink section and bath salts for the tub but that doesn’t make up for the dirtiness of this house.

Get ready to cook on the massive 6 burner gas range (or just enjoy the simple, prettiness of the kitchen). You will not be disappointed with the large, luxurious suites and high end bathrooms. You’ll never want to leave the sizable soaking tub with decadent soaps and salts. Visit Victoria, book this lovely cottage, take in Charlene’s Boutique for Unique Baubles and then recline on the patio for the evening. 5 ⭐️"

5 stars to the property manager and we highly recommend this home.
My only suggestion when booking any property on Airbnb Ask property managers prior to booking about any hiden cost (i.e cleaning, service fees). This can increase the your cost/budget by a few hundred."

Stayed with kids","I really would of loved to give this home a 5 star review but there were just a couple of areas that needed improvement. Overall a fantastic host, very accommodating & let us check in early. I reached out to her to she was very kind & quick to respond. The home good location near stores and food. The neighborhood is quite peaceful and if you need a place to stay this is a good option. The AC works wonderfully as well & the house was clean.
The reason for it being a 4 star review is i inquired about a pack & play beforehand & there was one but when we went to set it up, it was very gross. The rails of it brown & yellow stained & the mattress was gross. I ended up having to buy another because even with the sheet provided it was just very unclean. There was a lot of hardware on the walls that was barley hanging on/ broken/about to break including the shower door that came off during showers. 1 small tv in the whole house so we ended up moving it upstairs to relax in bed"

Stayed with a pet","My review will be based on the comfort of the living space as well as the beds since this was a business trip. The townhome and pics are as described. The place is very private and very quiet which is 5 *****. The rear greets you with uncleanliness due to all the fallen leaves which I wasn’t able to enjoy the peacefulness. My furbaby had plenty to keep him occupied. Now in regards to the bed I chose which is to the rear upstairs was so uncomfortable so I decided to elect the front bedroom due to comfort of that bed; however, you can’t rest due to the community lights of this area. I recommend black out curtains or curtains or move that bed to rear. Other than that I would recommend the stay."

Stayed a few nights","The townhouse is a bit older (still has a trash compactor!), but was very clean. The decor and furniture are very minimal and basic. We enjoyed the access to the pool! The neighborhood was quiet and convenient. Brittany was communicative and check-in/check-out was super easy."

Stayed a few nights","Probably the VERY BEST Air BnB experience we have had!
If you want 5-Star everything, don't like nature, wildlife, and bugs, this place is not for you. If you want to unplug, breathe fresh air, and see the stars, this IS the place for you.
If you want a big city and all the trappings, this place is not for you. If you want to rest, relax, and unplug, this IS the place for you. Close to Victoria, and even major metro areas, Houston, San Antonio, Austin, or Corpus Christi, yet remote.
The cute little cottage was well stocked (lots of edible goodies!, coffees & teas, toiletries, and other supplies), had multiple seating areas on the wrap-around porch and inside, with plenty of air-conditioning and fans.
If you are fortunate to have had a grandma and grandpa or aunt and uncle who you'd visit during summers or holidays who always made you feel welcomed in their home and spoiled you, well, you will understand this is how we felt this past weekend and Rene' and Ileen's!"

Stayed a few nights","The Cottage at Greyhouse Farms was absolutely wonderful! It was the perfect place to unwind after a day in the office! The cottage inside has everything a person could need and the wraparound porch was perfect for relaxing, reading a book and watching the deer. I was able to take a walk to the back of the property to check out the ponds, that was a perfect extra bonus! The location was private but close enough to go into town every day. The hosts were fantastic and reached out multiple times to see if I needed anything! Everything was very accommodating and I hope I get to visit again!"

The cottage was even cuter in person, there was a nice selection of snacks and drinks to choose from. The property was beautiful as well, it was nice to be in the peace and quiet and be able to walk around and really enjoy the nature around us. There wasn’t anything we would’ve changed. It was a perfect weekend away."

Stayed a few nights","Rene' & Ileen were the most gracious, friendly, accommodating hosts one could ask for. there Cottage was comfortable and very clean. kitchen had everything you'd need to prepare a full meal. Ileen added decor for the holiday and baked good, and snacks awaiting me in the fridge. heating and cooling worked perfectly, bath was fully stocked with more than anyone would need. Rene' and Ileen were there if needed at a moments notice, yet allowed for anyone to have as much privacy if wanted. hard to beat the country setting of quiet, natural pasture views, oak trees and sitting outside on the porch. Rene's sent me down to the pond and I got a chance to throw some flies in an attempt to catch bass or catfish. Superb hosts, like long time friends. I can't wait to return if my daughter doesn't beat me to it.
Thank you Rene' & Ileen"

Stayed a few nights","It was delightful! Restful, comfy, pretty. There were special touches in each area of the cottage. Morning coffee on the porch was especially nice when we saw the deer. The grounds of the property were immaculate - like we were in a country park. Our family lives nearby, so this was handy, too. They wanted to make sure we had everything we needed as well as have a good experience."

Stayed a few nights","My best friend and I stayed at the cottage for a weekend. We wanted to spend some quality girl time chatting and shopping. The cottage was so nice and clean. We loved the warm feeling and country atmosphere. We loved the fire pit, the wrap around porch, walking around the farm, all the tasty treats, bottle of wine, talking with the cows, deer watching, star gazing, and of course friendly hosts! Rene and ILleen are so kind and helpful. It is a must stay for anyone!! Next time I need to bring my fishing poles. I hope to come back sometime with my husband for a romantic weekend and possible fishing. The place is refreshing change from the hustle and bustle of the city or hot sandy beaches."

Stayed a few nights","The best stay ever!! Aside from the cottage being absolutely cozy, the scenery was as peaceful as peaceful gets. After a long hot day, it was so breath taking to sit on the wrap around porch enjoying dinner with the deer; about a dozen of them! Just beautiful!! The hospitality was the best in Texas! We arrived to water in the fridge and the best cinnamon muffins. Later that night, Illeen treated us with some local wine and great conversation about the history of the land. We can't wait to go back!! Thank again Rene' and Illeen!!!"
