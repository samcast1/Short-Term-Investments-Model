You'll be walking distance to convenient stores and the town square which has shops and places to eat and drink. I was responded to immediately by the hosts whenever I had a question. Everything is exactly as described in the listing.. I highly recommend booking your stay here if you need to visit the area!

Stayed a few nights",Stone St is near the downtown area. The neighborhood is a mix of older homes that have been renovated and some that have not . I felt safe taking a walk even at night and there are good walking trails close by and within a 10 min drive. I came for the eclipse but also enjoyed thrifting and dining. The Black River is beautiful and I loved seeing it from different viewpoints. Daniel was a good host and gave me good recommendations of where to go.

Stayed with kids","If you’re easy going and just want a clean place to lay your head, this will work. I have a bad back and the bed was not an issue.
Washer and dryer available.
Apt upstairs but bathroom was downstairs which was inconvenient for my child to use at night but I was okay with.
Host was super flexible and accommodating!!! He responded quickly to messages. Neighbors were very nice and even asked if the music was too loud which it never was. We slept good.
Would not stay again ONLY because bathroom was downstairs."

Stayed a few nights","Stayed here to take care of some things in Watertown and visited Niagara Falls (3hr drive). The beds were very comfortable and the place was exactly what we needed for our stay. Situated walking distance from St Patrick church was a plus where we attended mass on Sunday morning. Watertown is beautiful in the winter with tons of snow and Daniels place was a warm , cozy and clean place to come back to at the end of a busy day in the cold. Had all the necessary pots and pans to make meals comfortably. Some spices and cooking oil were provided along with filtered water pitcher for drinking water. And the snow in the driveway was shoveled for us with was a nice surprise that we didn’t expect. Enjoyed our stay, would stay here again when in Watertown."

We did however have a mishap and broke the lamp shade in the bedroom while we were staying (did not realize this until Michelle reached out after check out). She was very understanding and polite about it and we provided her the funds to replace it. Would recommend this Airbnb for anyone coming to the area!"

Kitchen- fully stocked with nice utensils, cooking ware, etc. very clean.
Dining room nice big table.
Living room - super comfy couch and cozy space for relaxing.
Upstairs has two bedrooms- one is a loft bedroom and one attached to the loft with a door— perfect for littles.
Beds were EXTREMELY comfortable.
Tons of extra towels and cozy clean blankets. Cannot stress CLEAN enough.
There was a Keurig with generous coffee cups and tea. Welcome snacks. Cleaning supplies, etc.
The owner has thought of everything. I will definitely bring my family back here again and again. Thank you, Michelle!!"

We took a 4 minute walk to a local brewery one evening and went and got coffee every morning that was less than a 5 minute drive. We seen deer lounging in the back yard one night which was pretty cool. Home was clean and Michelle was very attentive. Only complaint would be the train that comes through between 5 am and 6:30 am because it blows an enormously loud horn. Would stay here again!

Michelle has clearly put a lot of work into maintaining and updating the space and the care for cleanliness and comfort was obvious. There are neighbors in adjacent apartments, but they were friendly and we would never have known they were around except for a chance encounter outside. Our favorite part was the tidiness and lack of clutter - perfect for a family with a toddler. We have nothing but good things to say and would stay again in the future."

The neighborhood is so pretty. Huge, well kept old houses on a tree lined street with a shade canopy.
It is a spacious apartment with tons of amenities. It really has everything.
I was on a plane, getting ready to take off when I found out my initial lodging in Watertown fell through. Clancy replied immediately and I was booked!

Special touches throughout the nicely decorated yet functionally comfortable home. Special thank you to the host as she provided nice extras for us, which made a difference for us upon arrival. Check out her suggestions for places to shop and visit. We had originally thought to stay in Alexandria Bay as we wanted to visit the Thousand Islands. After touring that area, we are much happier we made the choice to stay in Watertown at Clancy's place, only 30 minutes from Alex Bay. It is much nicer to stay here, easier to find groceries, and has a nice area for walking or visiting the downtown area for food or riverwalk."

Stayed one night","Decent house if driving through central New York. The driveway and appearance of the house are very nice and upscale, with a new porch and asphalt. Inside you will find a soft couch, big tv, and beautiful woodwork on rhetorical ceiling. The rules list was on the table, and it had a few unexpected things on it but nothing major. A few of the photos, mainly the bathroom did not match the listing due to some recent renovations. A couple of the doors didn’t want to close and latch in the bedroom and bathroom, but the fixtures were nice quality. The bed, while big is very firm with soft linens. The kitchen looks very nice, with a lot of lighting fixtures to have great visibility at night. A few of the light switches in the house were wired backwards so it took a few minutes to figure out how to turn some things on and off. Overall it is a decent value for the money in a quiet neighborhood, with a few quirks on the fit and finish on their new renovations."

There was coffee and sugar- so nice to have in the kitchen when we arrived! We will definitely be booking this home again when we visit on our future trips.

I was surprised, I loved it, and I would never stay at a Local Hotel in Watertown again if this option were available.
I've stayed at a lotta Hotels & AIRBB's throughout the Nation over the years, and would rank this one near the top for a variety of reasons.
The Host did a Spectacular Job here with his remodel .. the floors, ceilings, walls, doors, fixtures, lighting, kitchen, furniture, bedroom .. every inch of this place was rebuilt to a high quality standard, well thought out and contains brand new modern features.
It's in a walkable area, private parking, nicely stocked with kitchenware, tons of switches for all its modern lighting and fans but hey guess what?? .. the Host Labeled all this stuff quite well so NP, no electrical schematic needed!!

I had a few questions before staying here, and Jeff and Amanda were quick to respond and very helpful.
We immediately felt at home here: the living room and bedrooms were very comfortable, the kitchen had everything we needed (and more), and the bathroom was well stocked. It's so nice to go away for a few days and not have to lug full-size toiletries with you!
Getting into the house was extremely easy with the number lock, and everything worked properly. The place was very clean and welcoming. When we first walked in, there was a bottle of wine waiting for us and some bottled water in the fridge. We also had little chocolates in the bedroom.
Next time I'm in the Thousand Islands area, I definitely will check if this AirBNB is available. I'd give it more than five stars if I could."

Stayed with kids","Nice place. Great location. Close to Fort Drum, shopping and restaurants. Felt at ease here. Worked out way better than a stuffy hotel room. The hosts are wonderful. Quick to respond. Nice touches to welcome guests upon arrival. I’ll leave those extra special touches a secret for future guests to find upon their arrival. But I loved them and very much appreciated them 😌.
This place has just about everything you’ll need to make your stay great. They even have folks that clear snow away. Playground is literally next door within steps.
I would definitely return and stay here again.
***only negative, if you want to call it that, is that it’s a duplex with thin walls, so if someone occupies the home next door you can hear everything clearly which means they too can hear you clearly.
You’ll find the same thing though if you stay in a hotel room as their walls are thin as well.
Not a big enough negative to stop me from returning."

Stayed about a week","Amanda's place met all the requirements we were looking for visiting our son who is stationed at Fort Drum - especially being close to base because we didn't know how much time we were going to be able to see our soldier. It was easy for him to come and go being that close to his duty station. We wanted more of a home like feel rather than a hotel stay (especially being there for over a week) with separate bedrooms so we could have some privacy, a living room to hang out and visit, and a kitchen to cook breakfast/lunch/dinner (plus we brought homecooked meals). I enjoyed the ""extras"" that were provided - snacks, wine, toilet paper, kleenex, spices/seasonings, foil, shampoo/conditioner, soap, detergent. All those were helpful towards the keeping the grocery bill affordable with all the other necessities we needed to purchase. I loved the pond across the street with the Canadian Geese!! I felt like we were in a great location (besides being close to base) to easily travel to the little towns we wanted to check out. I would definitely stay here again."

The location and space made it easy to visit back and forth snd to check out the area farmstands, state parks, Lake Ontario and 1000 Islands. The beds were comfy and Amanda made sure we had what we needed to be comfortable.
Great little place to stay!"

A wonderful value for the money!
They have lots of little touches that are really great! Greeting with a bottle of wine, coffee in the cupboard, complimentary snacks for when you arrive and are peckish when you haven’t made it to the grocery store just yet. Speaking of grocery, there’s a Walmart less than 5 minutes away by car, so everything you need for a long weekend is right there.
We had a special occasion to be in the area, and though I don’t expect to be back this way anytime soon, I’d stay here again in a heartbeat. The hotels down the street aren’t worth it! Get yourself this cozy house for your getaway!

Stayed with a pet","Had a fantastic stay here in Watertown while visiting family. This apartment was in a perfect location, super quick and easy to drive to everywhere we needed to go (and some surprisingly good food; ie. Maggie's). The hosts were very responsive to our messages and willing to accommodate our needs at every turn. While the place does cater to those with pets, it was extremely clean and there were no signs of repeated use of pets on any of the furniture. We will definitely be staying here again when visiting family and recommend you do as well!"

Stayed with kids","Looked exactly like the pictures, matched the description, and worth the price! We stayed here to visit my friend in Ft. Drum so the location was great and very convenient. Walmart, target, fast food restaurants close by. The main bed is sooo comfortable and the couch was perfect for a movie night. A couple of things: the laundry is down in a basement (not mentioned in description) and you can hear the upstairs neighbors, however these things does not mean that this listing does not deserve the 5 stars."

So tiny, felt claustrophobic and the tv was also so small and had horrible quality picture. I had to downgrade my PSV settings just to be able to use it.
The WiFi was also unusable so that was great. It worked half-decently on my phone but didn’t work at all on laptop or gaming console. She apparently set up her NAT some dumb way."

Her recommendations were also on point! I ended up doing a lot of things she had in her guidebook and my stay was all the better for it.
She definitely has a gift for communicating in writing -- frank, funny, clear -- and I got a very solid sense of her via her listing and back and forth messages!
As a space, her place was awesome! She clearly has excellent taste and has decorated and designed it extremely well. The bedroom was cozy and inviting, the bathroom is incredibly well designed (the tile work!), and the living room was a comfy place to sit and read.
Overall I couldn't have been more thrilled with her place and her as a host and if I'm ever near there again will definitely try to book a return stay!"

I have to say I got a great breakfast at an awesome hangout space called Starch. I will definitely be going back there! Jessica is a wealth of information and was very helpful when I had trouble navigating the town. I highly recommend booking a room here. It was one of the nicest and cleanest Airbnbs I've stayed in.

There is a little work desk in the room, if I needed to do more, and there is room in the closest for a suitcase and a dresser with roomy drawers, if desired. The whole place is not only immaculate but decorated with impeccable taste. I especially appreciated the nice shower, the comfy bed, the local restaurant recommendations, and the peanut butter bar she gave me the morning of my departure. This was only because she was making them for an annual charity event that morning, but it shows you her kindness. The deal is unbeatable, and you will not regret meeting Jessica!"

Stayed one night","Perfect overnight stay on my way to Ogdensburg for an appointment. Room exactly as pictured. Bed firm and comfortable, really nice linens. Shared bathroom is immaculate with top quality fixtures and finishings. Quiet neighborhood, well located near anything you'd want in Watertown.
Jessica is particular about her place–which is what you want in a host. She keeps the house super clean and she expects guests to treat the place with respect. In return, you get a great stay with no surprises. Her instructions are detailed, specific, and copious(!), and she makes her boundaries super clear–critical when you're sharing space with a host. . And all of this fastidiousness is done in a warm, friendly, and playful way. You never feel like she's uptight, just exact! For me, that's perfect because the one risk with an AirBnB is that you won't get what you're expecting–Jessica takes that risk out of the picture and I was so grateful!"

Stayed a few nights","Convenient and clean stay! Jessica was a very communicative host. We had a nice time in Watertown and the area—and Jessica gave us some great suggestions that she included in the house rules and information binder. She also suggested some places prior to us coming—and the suggestions were excellent! Her house is quite clean and looks modern and updated. She has a cute and sassy cat. One thing to note is that the host requires sole use of the bathroom for 45 minutes on weekday mornings to accommodate for her work schedule, so it would be helpful to arrange your itinerary to avoid bathroom use around that time. It’s also good to go through the online manual (available to view after booking) and printed manual (located in the room) since there are a number of rules to the house. Her place is conveniently located near Sackets Harbor and 1000 Islands—and Watertown itself has a number of interesting venues. We had a nice stay."

Stayed a few nights","So, ok, there are rules to stay here so you should really read her House Rules in her description. Most of the stuff is obvious to me as a fairly mannered person, but I’m sure there are some out there that need a refresher on proper protocol. Actually, you really NEED to read the house manual because it’s pretty funny. In person she is just as open and funny as her writing.
There is plenty of room to park off street, everything in the house is very modern and actually much nicer than any Marriott or Hilton I have ever stayed in. Although I saw that there were quite a few nice restaurants around the house i never got to try any because i was working long hours.
Biggest rule…..

Thank you Larry seriously we appreciate you."

The host was incredibly responsive throughout our stay, ensuring that any questions or concerns we had were addressed promptly. The apartment itself was impeccably clean and remarkably comfortable, providing us with a cozy and inviting atmosphere to relax in during our trip. What truly stood out, however, was the host's exceptional kindness and generosity. In the midst of our departure rush, we accidentally left behind a pair of AirPods. Without hesitation, Larry took the initiative to assist us, going out of their way to mail the AirPods back to us. This thoughtful gesture not only exemplifies the host's commitment to ensuring their guests have a fantastic stay but also showcases their genuine care and consideration. We are truly grateful for such an incredible experience and recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a fantastic place to stay in Watertown."

We stayed 3 nights and purpose of the trip was to see things in the 1000 Island area, but Larry's place was a 29 mile drive one way. Even though location may not have been ideal, we think the price for Larry's place compared to places closer more than offset gasoline cost."

Everything was clean and ready for me, instructions were easy to follow, host was super good at communicating and very nice!!
I had *slight confusion when I arrived just to make sure I found the right door, but I figured it out quickly and everything worked great for us for the weekend. Nice shower, we loved being able to do laundry, the deck outside is a nice touch. Kitchen was good, HUGE TV and comfy couch, and my Chihuahua liked watching things out the window 😁
I would definitely stay again if I have to come back to Watertown!!"

Stayed over a week",I origionally booked the downstairs for 3 months. Early on i saw that was not long enough so I extended to 5 months. Unfortunately I realized that was still not long enough. When i went to extend this was already booked. They worked with me to move to the upstairs. I wound up staying there for 10 months. This was the best summer I've spent even though it was for work. They bent over backwards for anything I ever needed. This section is not big enough for me to explain all the steps they took above and beyond to make me feel like I were at home. I'm sure I will be traveling back up there in the future for a week at a time and I will definetly be staying at my second home. I have also recommended this to all of my work colleagues. I also had me 3 sons come up and spend a week during the 4th of July and they loved the place and to area. Thank you Leticia and Geraldo!!

Stayed one night","Loved this place! Host extremely accommodating and friendly. Apartment was lovely, furniture (most notably the beds) were extremely comfortable. I felt very safe in the location, overall A++++
The only note I would make - access to the apartment is up the outside stairs in the pictures. They were a bit steep for my elderly mother. The stairs are managed well with slip strips and warning signs, and salt available - should not be a deterrent for most people. The beds were amazing but quite high off the ground. I was extremely happy though my mom struggled a bit. Very minor issues for most people, overall the apartment is clean, quiet and very comfortable. I wish I could have stayed longer. The price is certainly a deal! I would definitely recommend for a stay in the area."

Stayed a few nights","Whenever I'm in the area visiting family, I always choose Beth's place - Collie Cottage. This detached spacious in-law apartment is so homey and comfortable and tucked away off the road so it's very quiet too. You can tell it was designed for her much loved parents when they retired.
The entire place is well equipped for any need. Beth keeps the bathroom stocked with toiletries so you won't need to worry if you forget some essentials. Same goes for the kitchen -- you'll find basic spices, cooking oil and even a nicely stocked coffee bar in the corner of the counter. The two bedrooms are roomy and always clean comfortable beds. From dining area you can look out the large glass sliding doors past the patio to enjoy an open view of a natural stone wall adjacent to a field with horses grazing peacefully.
Book this one well in advance of you visit because it doesn't stay vacant long!"

He is a quiet gentleman who is happy to keep you company but won't come inside uninvited. But when he does, you'll need to make room for him next to on the couch as he loves to stretch out for a tummy rub or ear scratch.
The apartment is exceptionally clean and well stocked. Every thing you need is already there from toiletries to Streaming TV to kitchen supplies. . . I even found breakfast makings: pancake mix & syrup!

She even provided some waters and sodas, and snacks and treats throughout the house. Those little extra touches make a house feel like a home. The bathroom is fully equipped as well. Tons of great quality towels are provided, beds and pillows and sheets are super comfy, and the living room boasts a very large TV. There is a nice, large comfy couch as well as a recliner. There are lots of hooks around to hang things. In the backyard, there is a nice, private patio that overlooks an incredible rock-wall, beautifully decorated with flowers and ornaments. Books and LPs and a turntable are also available. This is clearly the nicest place we've ever stayed in through Airbnb.

Stayed about a week","Let me just preface that I have stayed in many Airbnb’s and this one is by far the best. Beth is the most amazing host. She is caring, kind and thoughtful every time she accepts a new guest into her space. She makes them feel like it’s their home away from home. Cleanliness is a 100/10, she goes above and beyond for your stay. The Collie Guest House has everything you could need and more. I am so thankful that we found this space on this trip and I can’t wait to come back. Beth you are awesome, thank you so much!"

Beth is super friendly and kind host, and we had the best vacation time, visiting Cape Vincent, Bonaparte Lake, Syracuse and more. Will happily come back and rend this place again."

Everything about this place is pristine. Kitchen was spotless, bathrooms were spotless, and bedrooms were spotless. This is home is located within walking distance of the local attractions. Finding the house was easy. I appreciated the little things supplied by the owner; for example a well stocked coffee bar. Instructions for checking in / out were very clear. Highly recommend this property. Thank you Vincent, for a wonderful experience."

The house doesn't look like much from the outside but inside is fully a renovated and modern feeling condo that is very spacious, and clean. I like the upstairs bedrooms and two washrooms for bigger groups. Would absolutely stay again as my buddies and I all feel Michelle hit all the details."

I was helping my daughter move with her baby while my son is deployed and needed an extra night in town at the last minute. This place was clean, super comfortable, and cutely decorated. The beds are so comfortable and I could have family there and hang out if we had time to. We will definitely hope to stay again. This place has won me over!"

Kitchen was well supplied although the largest of the pans is warped a bit so be careful cooking on the stove top. Bedrooms are cozy, linens were clean and looked newer, pillows are super firm."

Stayed a few nights","Shawn’s home was exactly as described! It was warm and homey! Clean and comfortable! We were there to visit our soldier who had recently returned to Fort Drum from deployment and this was a great spot to relax. Very close to the base. The kitchen had everything we needed, including spices, to make a nice home-cooked dinner. The beds were quite comfortable. The view of the river from the deck was lovely! We did not go on the river but did take a nice walk on the trail across from the house.
It was a quick two day visit but it was just what we needed. I would recommend staying here if you are visiting the area. Shawn was very responsive and friendly. Easy check in and check out!"

Instructions and directions to the utilities at our disposal was clear and understandable. Shawn made us feel at home. We absolutely loved staying here and would love to come back!
Worth every dollar and more! Would recommend this highly!
P.S There are fishing rods and a kayak (or a river raft) that we weren’t able to use but would’ve been an amazing addition to our time here."

The owner was great. He (I assume it was him) came out and cleared the driveway for us which was great because we had no clue what to do with all of the snow.
We enjoyed our stay very much and were really sad to leave."

Group trip","My friends and I stayed the night here because we needed to drop our friend off at the base at 6am. We live an hour and a half away and were unaware of the water shortage in Watertown until he warned us, and offered us an out last minute. We all agreed we could work around it and continue on as planned and I am glad we did. The area’s beautiful and peaceful, and we compared the home to feeling like we were “at grandmas house”. Sometimes airbnbs can feel a little too perfect, almost like you cant touch anything but this was a warm/cozy feeling house. There were card games left out, plenty of pillows and blankets, and the tv was set up with access to tons of movies. The beds/bedrooms impressed us as well. They were perfect for a bunch of night shifters to get decent sleep! Overall we really enjoyed our night here!"
