Stayed with a pet","Very clean and cozy. Beds were comfortable and the house had everything we needed. Everything was as advertised, and overall happy with the stay. We would definitely stay here again, as it’s nice to have an option in Evanston.
As others have stated, the stairs are steep. We expected this to be the case, but the one thing I do suggest for the owners is to install railing on the top level by the stairs to help reduce fall risk. We have a 2 year old and were nervous about this. With the A-frame, the 2nd floor has limited head space surrounding the stairs so you sort of have to lean as you’re walking across the loft near the stairwell opening, and the floor is narrow right there. A rail up there would be a helpful safety feature for this property."

Stayed about a week","This place was perfect! From the decor to the layout of the place, it was exactly what I needed. The stairs leading upstairs are indeed steep but they do list that in the description prior to booking. I had no issues with the stairs. The house was clean and tidy. Bed was so comfortable! Check-in with the lock box was simple enough to get into for the house.
I would definitely stay here again in I am ever in the area!"

Stayed with kids","With two adult daughters and three grandkids in tow, we were a big loud group. The space was clean and fit all of the fun perfectly. It was a nice surprise to find a packnplay in the closet in the upstairs room and it came in very handy. Check in was easy peasy and there were clear simple instructions for check out. Thank you for giving us a spot where we could spread out and relax after a long late drive.
Would definitely stay here again."

Stayed with kids","We loved our stay! Cute place. Our family had fun ice skating at the bear river gateway, sledding and seeing the bison and elk at bear river state park, and eating out at the hibachi restaurant. Evanston is a really lovely. And the airbnb was perfect! We love this fun little place. The bathroom was pristine. The kitchen was awesome, beds comfy, living room was perfect for our movie night. We had the best time. Thank you! The guest contacts for this property are super responsive and we appreciated them so much. Excellent customer service!"

Stayed a few nights","Enjoyed my stay at this location. Done very well, pristine inside, very clean. Enjoyed how everything is within walking distance (restaurants, bars, small casino) Venture just a little further and you have a Smiths grocery and Wal-Mart. Basic staples within easy driving distance. Only drawback (and it must have just been a bad night) is that the area got quite noisy with traffic, work trucks etc. Momentary nuisance and not a deal breaker though. Overall just a huge comfortable experience."

Stayed with a pet","This Beautiful little A-Frame cottage was peaceful, quiet, comfortable. (after you get the wall heaters and space heaters turned on. the beds upstairs are a bit challenging for me being 6'3"" I had to do a lot of creative movements to land myself on the bed without being pushed down by the ceiling. (My wife and I made a game of it haha) the stairs are depicted in the photos but the photos do not do justice of how STEEP they are. that was my only real complaint. I have an older dog who is still active thank goodness, but these stairs proved to be a challenge for him, and it was scary to watch him climb down. the stairs are more like a ladder. I feel like that needs to be said.
but there is plenty of parking a space on each side of the house. the furniture is comfortable. there's coffee and tea to start your morning right. and it's a beautiful space to spend quality time with friends and family! we loved reading the guest journal and seeing pase renters thoughts and adventures!"

Stayed over a week","Bathroom- having a place to hang wet towels, an adult size commode, and a tp holder somewhere where else so it doesn't poke into your side while you're sitting... would all be a major plus.
Just so everyone knows, the beds are on the floor, and there's not even a privacy curtain for the main room. Best method for getting up (if you're older like me) is rolling onto your stomach and pushing up that way."

Stayed with kids","Cute place and very clean. But if you’re one that gets claustrophobic, be prepared that with the triangular shape, it doesn’t have tall ceilings. Some of the shingles needed repair as well. I thought no AC wouldn’t be a huge deal but the way heat rises made the upstairs very warm at night."

Stayed with a pet","We booked this home for a weekend wedding and it was perfect. We didn't cook so can't speak to the kitchen's set up, but a glance through the cabinets showed it was well stocked with the usual kitchen-stuff. I appreciated the very nice coffeemaker and new bag of coffee. Wifi worked really well and we were able to get to and from where we needed to be easily. The interior is clean and nicely decorated. Really charming!
Couple of things for future guests. There's a very loud street a short distance from the home and you can hear it from inside. While the description says 6 guests, I think four max is comfortable. The futon in the living room is really uncomfortable; I don't recommend sleeping on it. There's a queen bed and two twin beds upstairs though. The stairs leading upstairs are really steep, but have motion lighting that helps at night.
Overall, it was a great place to stay. Really unique and a pretty fun experience. I'd stay there again."

The kitchen was fully stocked with everything to cook our dinners, and she went above and beyond in checking in on us, making sure we had everything we needed, and clearing all of the snow on the sidewalks throughout the weekend. Her and her husband were so kind and friendly. I highly recommend booking with her and her husband! We will definitely be staying there again if we find ourselves up that direction!"

Stayed a few nights","What a great place and great hosts. They'll tell you about the town and its history and help answer any questions that you may have. It's great because it's its own unit. You don't share with anyone. There is plenty of room. The kitchen is a great touch because you can bring your own food and cook if you want to as opposed to eating out. Microwave with bags of popcorn, full sized fridge and freezer, utensils, plates and an oven. Nice sized television. Very clean. The area is beautiful with Echo Canyon east and Weber Canyon west. If you like fishing or rafting, it looks like a great area to visit and this is a great place to stay. I will make this a place that I would visit and stay at again."

Stayed a few nights","This airbnb is in serious needs of repairs, and deep cleaning.
1. the front door lock jams and does not lock properly
2. the entire place needs a deep cleaning. the floors to the counter tops were stained
3. there are mice in the house
4. be aware the laindry area is a shared space. after doing some much needed cleaning we headed out to the store and left the door to the laundry area open (thats where the cleaning supplies were kept) we did not realize that was a shared space upon arrival back to the house there was a man inside the laundry room. which meant our belongings were not secure from strangers.
5. there are random holes in the ceiling and around the light fixtures. it honestly feels like someone is watching you.
6. there were soiled blankets left on the bed
7. the restroom is dark and dingy old tissue on the side of the toilet and the rugs hadn't been washed in so long they were stiff.
the only saving grace for this place is its location and beautiful view."

Stayed a few nights","The best thing about Jonathan’s Airbnb is it’s close proximity to the Roundhouse where the Celtic Music Festival was held. The bed and bedding was fairly comfortable. But for being listed as a whole unit, it was under furnished and the kitchen wasn’t really stocked with basic staples. We did ok since we ate most of our meals out. The living area was under furnished. The house may sleep 4 but they wouldn’t all have a place to sit down for a chat or watch tv.
We came to attend the festival and since we are musicians, the appeal of staying in an Airbnb is the ability to sit and have a music session before or after the show. Some basic chairs in the unit would have been appreciated.
The house is very old and has clearly been renovated and updated. I hope they go the extra mile and have a deep clean and have a real cook go in to make it a cooks kitchen."

Hannah and her husband were so kind and helpful. The living room is big and very comfortable. Everything we needed was there and it was clean and just felt like we were at home.

Stayed with kids","Hannah’s place was perfect, so spacious and it had everything we needed. The beds and bedding were comfy, and the incredible living room rug was so cushy and comfy on my weary feet. The parking behind the house has enough space for several cars, and it is right next to the apartment entrance which made it so nice on a frigid December night. She also let us park our giant Uhaul truck in her driveway in front. Really a great place to stay on our trip, would definitely stay again if I am ever coming this way on a road trip."

The place is very spacious and will be absolutely wonderful once the remodel/construction is complete.
The property is so quiet that the silence is deafening if you’re coming from an urban environment.
We woke up to deer grazing in the back yard and grouse flying around in the tall grass. We’d defiantly stay if we pass through again."

The cabin was beautifully decorated and had everything I needed. The area around the cabin was breathtaking and full of wonder. The ranch’s free range cattle greeted me in the morning, then “Whitey” herded them away. I heard many birds on my morning walk. To name a few: Finches, Red-winged Blackbird, Eurasian Collared-Dove, Western Meadowlark, Sandhill Crane, Sparrows, Yellow-headed Blackbird, Yellow Warbler, Eastern Kingbird, House Wren, Bullock’s Oriole, Mourning Dove, Grackles, Hummingbirds, Ducks & Geese .. just to name a few.

Even texting at 10:30 pm to let us know the yard and front porch was all lit up. Debbie went above and beyond to ensure we had a perfect vacation.

The place is a little remote, which adds to the charm. There are very very few amenities in 'town'. A microwave and small fridge, but no stove in cabin. BBQ and fire pit outside. Bring groceries from Evanston if you come in from the south.
If I am anywhere near, I will stay there again."

We paddled around on the lake, walked the dirt roads, built a campfire…all the things we hoped to do. The bed in the loft was a little too tiny for my husband and me (we’re both around 6’ tall), but no problem! The futon was the better option for sleeping. All in all we had a great time!"

The home was cozy, clean, and had everything that I needed. I enjoyed watching the sunset and sunrise in the beautiful surroundings. Extremely quiet and comfortable. Slept well. I was a little nervous about the bumpy road in/out to the place but all ended up just fine (I drive a Toyota Corolla), I took it extra slow. Would stay again and recommend to others. Thank you!"

Stayed with kids","This tiny home is in a beautiful spot with a private lake. We had an amazing sunset and really enjoyed stargazing at night. The futon isn’t really practical for 2 people as it’s extremely creaky. We finally moved the mattress to the floor to get some sleep. The bed in the loft is great and my kids were comfortable. The ceiling fan and light are on the same switch so we were unable to use the fan at night but an additional plug in fan was available and that worked well. We blew a fuse in the morning running the microwave and coffeemaker which was really inconvenient since the water pump doesn’t work without electricity so we had no water or lights for a bit until the host responded as to where the fuse box was located. I saw this happened to a previous guest as well, so it would be helpful to have this noted in the welcome manual as it was an easy fix once we knew where the box was located. Again, the outdoor setting is amazing and very peaceful."

Stayed one night","Taffy was always quick to respond & help us when we needed! I absolutely loved the location of this cute place! But I’m used to camping w bare min. so I expected just what was described, which was a BEAUTIFUL, peaceful spot w the amenities we needed! We did have a bit of an issue trying to get in & out of the place due to a very muddy “road” through the cattle field. (poured rain night before we arrived & when we were there). This would not have been a problem if we had an SUV or truck but we had a Prius& did get stuck. Taffy was very quick to respond & had a family member pull us out! Thank you Dan! Other issues we had: not being able to unfold futon & in the am before we left the power went out, (blow dryer & hot water same time. All that aside, I chalk up these events to part of the adventure with humor & will visit again!"

The only one teensy tiny thing was that we could have had a few less spiders, but given the location, it is to be expected. We would have loved to watch as the property owner added more fish to the lake, and were sad we missed it. Taffy was great and even reached out to let us know about the fish ahead of time. Having the private lake was just what the doctor ordered. We did it all, even with the rain."

Paddle boarding and boating on the lake is a lot of fun. Great views at sunrise and sunset. Dedicated fire pit convenient for making s'mores. All basic provisions are available.
Access road is rocky so a 4x4 helps. Shower force is extremely low and bath times are much longer. The house allows 4 guests, but wouldn't recommend it for 4 adults. 2 adults & 2 kids would be fine. It gets very hot in the afternoon and evening so the lack of air-conditioning makes it unpleasant. There's a ceiling fan & table fan though. It shouldn't be a problem if you're spending most of your time outside."

We all ohhhed and ahhhed as we pulled up as the sun started to set and they were both flummoxed as to how such a tiny house was able to hold the three of us as comfortably as it did. We enjoyed dinner around the fire ring, watching the sun set over the water, and all the fish and water fowl at the lake. It was the perfect place to get my kids off their screens for a spell. The water pressure in the shower was far from strong, but I didn’t book a tiny house for its water pressure. I booked it for a perfect getaway and that’s exactly what I got."

Secluded, peaceful, sunsets over the pond, lawn chairs for the porch, DVDs to watch, plenty of space considering the small home, and everything you need for basic cooking! Highly recommended"

I had all the necessities I could want. The kitchen was well supplied with cookware. I didn't realize I would be as close as I was to other houses (there are some within eyeshot) and at night the highway is slightly audible. But the stars were perfect and it is a good place if you are looking for something a little away from human interaction, but not too far."

The sunrise from the bedroom window and the sunsets over the private lake were glorious. Surrounded by ducks, birds, cows, it was like I had friends everywhere. The stars and milky way every night, only an hour from great parks and mountains. I got to feed bulls with Tony a few times and join the family for pole vaulting practice. Lyman/Fort Bridger is such a fun area. Got to see a Horse Pull, Lassoing practice, go to parks, cook over a campfire. Truly a special place I am so grateful I got to spend a month there.

The hot tub was a real treat especially given the cold, snowy weather. Finally, you could not ask for a better stocked kitchen. You could make anything your heart desires which is a real plus given that the location doesn't lend itself to dining out.
Lida is a great host. She is very responsive, coaching us through replicating her excellent fire building skills by text for example."

Stayed a few nights","I wanted four things specifically:
-To see the stars
-To be in the mountains
-Have a fire (outside/inside or both)
-A hot tub
This checked every box and then some! Lida was super helpful is providing directions and making sure we were prepared and knew what to expect weather wise, as it had snowed up there. We arrived to a pristinely clean cabin, fire already going and delicious cookies.
The cabin has everything you need to feel cozy and at home. The views are absolutely stunning. Plenty of space. We pretty much stayed on the main floor. There’s 4 rooms upstairs and a bathroom with a tub. Washer and dryer is upstairs as well. Linens are all clean and fresh.
The main level has a bathroom and walk-in shower, huge kitchen with a really nice stove and utensils and/or all the bakeware/cookware you could possibly image, huge living room with wood burning stove, TV, desk, two couches, two recliners and 2 HUGE tables AND the MOST comfortable bed ever (for anyone who might not be able to do the stairs). It’s an excellent cabin for families! We stayed downstairs pretty much the entire time, because we have a blind dog and a paralyzed dog, so it was just easier. And frankly, it was cozy.
Lida was also kind enough to let us do a later check out since we got in a little later on the first day. She was just incredibly friendly and accommodating. I really couldn’t recommend this place more highly. 5 stars all around!! We will DEFINITELY be back again!"

Group trip","Very very nice cabin. It was very cozy when we checked in. Only issue with cabin was one of guest bedrooms did not have a real mattress but a topper as a mattress.
Had some major miscommunication between both of us that created a bad experience. I wish we could have worked through the issue. I thought we had, but one of other owners got involved and asked us to leave. We happily left."

The beds are incredibly comfortable. The kitchen is well stocked. The outdoor seating is beautiful and comfortable. The hot tub is a delightful bonus. Watching the hummingbirds on the back porch became our favorite activity! We could not have asked for a better place to stay for two weeks. My kids are already asking when we go back!

Stayed over a week","What a wonderful, comfortable place! And what a great location from which to explore the surrounding areas.
We have been here for two weeks and often we didn't even see the need to leave the hillside. You can go hiking there, see the birds and wildlife, take a dip in the hot tub and enjoy the view, or go and feed the chickens and make a nice meal with the fresh eggs.
The house was built by Lida herself. Amazing place. Just look at the riverstone foundation. The floor heating is wonderful and a nice wood stove. The house has everything you need and Lida is very responsive if you would have any questions. And any time she would go to the supermarket, she would send me a message to ask if I needed anything. She brought cookies for the kids the neighbors baked, etc etc. She was excellent!
We will most definitely stay in touch with Lida and her family, and hopefully we will come back at some point to enjoy the place."

Stayed with kids",Let start off with how wonderful this place was. The rustic feeling was fantastic felt just like home being from the country. Jake the caretaker I believe and ranch hand checked in on us because it was a winter advisory storm with multiple road closures making sure we were okay and seeing if we were going to make it in. Then to our surprise we let them know it was for a family get together and dinner for pre Christmas thing for family we haven’t spent holidays with for 7 years and they set up a Christmas tree and decorated it. Don’t know if it’s a normal thing but we absolutely appreciated it. Beds were so comfortable and really nice place even with it being well below 0 we were nice and warm. The kids loved seeing the deer right out the front window. Would highly recommend this and will probably end up booking it for our summer trips to see the family.

The location is very remote and even several days after a snow storm the route can be treaturous. I was nervous one of my relatives might slide off one of the drop-offs and die in an accident on their way to the house. It is probably very lovely in non-winter months.
Bring Firewood with you. There's a fireplace but the host didn't seem to know about the fire shed that was referenced in the house manual. Also note that the pictures show an air mattress in the loft but there is no air mattress in the place. If you have kids that will want to sleep in the loft be sure to bring something to sleep on.
The kitchen was fully equipped and the pantry even had some extras that we found useful. The host was very accommodating when they were responsive."

The converted Barn on their ranch is the perfect distance from Lyman and Flaming Gorge, southern Wyoming and northern Utah and is a great way to slow down and disconnect in a very peaceful county setting. Wish we could have stayed longer.  Very highly recommend and we definitely plan to return when we have more time! 10 out of 5 stars!

Stayed one night","This place was very clean and it looked almost new on the inside -- cabinets, countertops, appliances, etc. The ""tiny house"" worked well for me, as I was by myself. It would probably be OK for a couple, but I think it would be cramped for 4 people. One of the ""bedrooms"" is an open loft that you have to climb a ladder to get to.
The place is very nice on the inside, particularly the kitchen area. It is fairly small though.
The owners are very friendly and the ""tiny house"" is next to their house. The place is very peaceful and quiet, which is what I was looking for.
It had 2 TV's -- one upstairs and one in the bedroom -- but I never turned them on. There was a roku remote, so presumably you can use apps through roku. The wifi worked very well for me. The temperatures were such that I did not need to use either the heating or cooling, so I do not know how well they worked.
I enjoyed staying here and I would like to stay here again if I am back in the area."

Stayed one night","After driving 1200 miles my band mate and I were looking for something clean, comfortable and not what bigger chain hotels and motels were charging. I found Amy’s place and requested a reservation after 7:30pm on the night we needed it. She responded well within an hour and sent detailed and easy to follow directions. We got to the property at 11 pm with the access code in hand and we’re actually blown away. What you see on the pictures is exactly what this place is modern and rural at the same time with one exception the pics can’t express the actual comfort and charm of not only the barn but the whole property. High end finishes and crisp clean linens make this place instantly feel like a little home. If you pass this place up you really are making a mistake. The Barn is worth every penny and is vastly superior to any overpriced and underwhelming motel or hotel your going to find in the same area. I would go out of my way to stay here again. Thanks Amy for the wonderful experience."

The host add a special touches by leaving fresh cookies. That made my daughter so happy! When I asked what she thought of our stay she said, “This place is fun and nice and I hope we stay here again.”
Guests are asked to not wear shoes in the apartment anytime. I appreciated this for keeping the space nicer. Also, it was rainy the second day that we were there and the parking area in front of the apartment was muddy. The tile floors in the kitchen were cold so I would recommend extra socks or slippers. The bedroom and loft are carpeted so they were comfortable.
I would highly recommend staying here."

Stayed with a pet","Where to begin? This Airbnb has truly exceeded all our expectations. In my past Airbnb experiences usually something would be lacking but this stay had absolutely no flaws. Upon entering we were greeted with a great smelling home & warm fireplace. Their attention to detail is phenomenal. We loved the little lights that adorned the inside of the house, as it contributed to a lovely ambient. We have never stayed at an Airbnb where the interior was similar to one straight out of a magazine. The bed was so cozy & the bathroom had everything you could need. This place in all seriousness felt like home & is in pristine condition. Kristie was extremely prompt with communication & you can tell she cares about ensuring that her guests have a great stay. We enjoyed our unexpected winter wonderland escape & look forward to bringing the rest of the family this upcoming summer. Even though I would like to keep this beautiful place a secret, I would highly recommend booking here. 10/10!!!"

Stayed about a week","Our stay was perfect. The location was close to all of our hunt areas. The historic building had incredible charm and has been redone beautifully. It was very comfortable and made a wonderful base camp after hard days hiking in the foothills & mountains. The separate bedrooms ensured a good nights rest and the kitchen was a must as we planned all of our own meals. Teresa was accommodating, friendly, and respectful of our privacy. She did a fantastic job hosting us. We will be back in the future if lucky enough to draw tags again. Highly recommended as a great little hideaway in Henefer. Thank you Teresa and family!!

The bunk beds are huge. The tv is a smart tv so you can log into Hulu or whatever you’d like. We were close to lots of different lakes, and the scenery around is so beautiful. It was fun to just drive around & enjoy the red rocks and country lands. We found a cute small petting zoo about 40 min away and went to that with the kids and we had so much fun! We will come back here! The host was so nice as well! Very responsive."

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful scenery, peaceful surroundings, clean, comfortable, spacious, and lots of character. I would describe it as a private studio-ish place. (Meaning, the bedroom does not have privacy doors.)
The pictures need to be updated on the site, as it has been more fully decorated, and the details put into it are just darling. The place is absolutely charming.
It was hard to leave, and go back to city life.
We went to the Thurston family sleigh rides, (year round) and really enjoyed it! A must visit.
Location is amazing! Close to several lakes, Salt Lake City, Ogden, SLC airport, ski resorts etc., most within 20-60 minutes.
Highly recommend staying here. You will not regret it. The price is amazing!! :)"

And, the view was nothing short of fabulous. the only thing I would caution is that this home is not easily accessible for anyone with challenges walking. to enter the home, you do have to leave the walkway and climb a small hill that is not well lit. however, if you don't have any limitations, this home is an absolute treat! Emily's home is now one of our most favorite places to stay."

Stayed a few nights",Emily’s place is a wonderful stay. Originally I though it was part of the main house but it is a full separate unit built above a two car garage at the back of the property. The property is immaculate as is the entire neighborhood of gorgeous homes. It is a quiet residential area- so if your looking for a party space- this is not it. The apartment is exactly as pictured and described. It’s an open floor plan with only one bedroom and a trundle bed in the family room. The bedroom is literally open to the kitchen with no door so not a lot of privacy- but for a family with two kids or couple traveling alone it’s perfect! It’s about 20 minutes away from Snowbasin and the main City of Ogden. There’s a little grocery store down the highway with everything you need. Emily was very kind and responsive- great hostess. Would love to come back in the wintertime for some skiing. This place is a wonderful value.

Comfy beds. Most comprehensive kitchen I’ve ever seen in an Airbnb. Super quiet. Super safe. Super private. Great view of the mountains. Tons and tons of thoughtful touches, from the decorations to board games/puzzles to little soaps and fragrances to spices and oils for cooking... really thought of everything. Top tier Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. Excellent location that is in nature but only 20mins from stores and restaurants (and 45 from the airport and downtown SLC, 50mins to Park City).
The host was delightful and extremely responsive. Helped with multiple needs throughout the stay super quickly and graciously. Very nice family and pets as well (not inside the Airbnb, which is separate, but greeting us to and from our car). Check-in and check out were a breeze.
Strongly recommended, great find. Will definitely be back!"

Stayed one night","This listing is a gem in the foothills of the mountains in northern UT. Very nice property, excellent accommodations, and very spacious interior for a small family to stay.
I searched for a comfortable place to stay for a night to break up a long drive back to Colorado and my visit exceeded my expectations! Highly recommend."

Stayed one night",Perfect spot outside of SLC/Ogden. We had a wonderful stay at this gorgeous little Airbnb while passing through town. The chickens were an excellent addition and the elevator was a great help after a 12 hour drive. I take the opportunity to stay here if you have the chance! Thank you Emily!

Stayed one night","If I could give more than 5 stars I would! The apartment itself is absolutely adorable, super clean, quiet, and that VIEW is incredible. Emily went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and overall was just the best host. Will absolutely book again when we are in the area!!"

Stayed a few nights",The place has everything we need. Even an elevator! Makes unloading heavy luggage (like a ski bag) a breeze..The location is great if you wanna ski snowbasin. It’s just off the highway. The view from the balcony is marvelous on a sunny day. We’d definitely come back next time.

Stayed a few nights",Offers many opportunities to get out and explore different activities or just stay in and enjoy quiet time Beautiful and peaceful Emily was respectful of our privacy and space but also good about reaching out to let us know she was there for us. On a personal note She was kind enough to make my husband's birthday just a bit sweeter We will be looking forward to staying here again.

Stayed a few nights","So happy I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday. The space was beautiful and clean, and the view is hard to beat. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook/bake and even had a coffee maker and tea kettle (with a nice assortment of coffee, tea, and snacks as well). The smart TV was great for watching shows/movies and listening to music. There was an awesome selection of books and boardgames - we played a ton of scrabble. Overall, such a pleasant stay and I’d love to do it again:) Thanks Emily!"

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I chose this location as a quiet weekend for our honeymoon getaway and were very happy to find our high expectations exceeded. Emily provided very clear directions for getting there and getting settled in. The house was very clean when we arrived, and my wife commented many times on how cute the place was. The kitchen was stocked with snacks, and if you decided to stay and cook, there are plenty of dishes and pans provided. The living room was also a big bonus as there was a huge flat-screen TV for you to watch Netflixor any other app you have access to. Overall, we would give Emily an easy 5 star review for our experience and would recommend this place to anyone wanting a quiet getaway in a beautiful location."

Stayed a few nights","I needed a few days to myself in relative peace and quiet to do some writing. This place was great for that (except for some work going on in the sub-basement, it didn't last long). Tons of space, gorgeous well-appointed kitchen, super friendly host. This is an over the garage space that feels like a condo. Perfect for one or two people, there is a comfy single in the living room, perfect for watching Netflix or Amazon or Disney+ on a very large screen. The views are awesome out the windows and on the small deck. The whole area is gorgeous. I found hiking trails a mile or two down the road and I jogged them every day. It is ""out there"" a ways, so if that's what you're looking for, this is the place. There's a small market/gas station about a mile away. And a grocery store about five miles away in Morgan. Or you're ten minutes from South Ogden. But the kitchen has a full-size refrigerator, so do some shopping and then use the handy elevator to bring up your bags. Cute place!! Chicken coop right outside the door. Deer wander around at night, and likely other critters. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"

Stayed one night","The views alone are five stars here. The hosts is friendly and accommodating and the place is clean, modern and spacious but still has a warm vibe with the butter yellow tiles and fireplace in the kitchen. Emily even offered fresh eggs (from her chickens) and cream for breakfast. Really great touches on what is a beautiful property."
