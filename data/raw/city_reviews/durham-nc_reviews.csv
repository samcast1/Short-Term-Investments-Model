Stayed with a pet","Amos’ place was as described, in a safe neighborhood with plenty of parking and a great value if looking for a comfy bed for a weekend visit to Durham. Also nice was that my friend was able to bring her pup. The apartment was free of dog hair even though it is pet friendly. The place was well stocked with thoughtful conveniences such as bug spray, doggie bags and Q-tips. Thanks Amos!"

Stayed with a pet","We have no complaints about our stay with Amos. He was very responsive, allowed us to check in an hour early when we asked, and made us feel right at home. It was the perfect set up for our dog, with a fenced in back yard and in an area easy for walking. It’s the perfect location to be right next to downtown, but also far enough to have quiet and privacy."

Stayed one night","Amos' place is very comfortable and well-located. I didn't have my dog with me, but I know it can often be a challenge to find dog welcoming places on road trips. Amos' place is perfectly set up for that which I appreciate as an occasional dog-traveller. As for we humans, the bed was comfortable, the AC nice and cool, and the couch comfy for working and watching shows. It's a great value."

Stayed with a pet","Amos was a great host! He was very responsive before booking when I had questions about his pet policy. He was also very helpful and flexible when I realized last minute that I'd made a mistake with my original booking. The place was exactly as described and his instructions/information was very clear and helpful. The place itself was cute and cozy and perfect for what I needed. His place was very pet friendly with bowls, a big dog bed, waste bags, cleaning supplies, towels, and blankets for my dogs. Everything was clearly labeled so I knew what could or couldn't be used for them too (towels/blankets/etc). My dogs loved his big fenced-in backyard which was the biggest perk!"

Stayed with a pet","This place was just what we needed for our 2-3 day stay in Durham. It was easy to access, in close proximity to downtown areas, comfortable, private, and quiet. All the amenities were there and it was convenient having a washer/dryer, and other little extras. We had our cat stay with us, and she was super comfortable there. It was clean, with the exception of a little pet hair, which is understandable when you're hosting pets. The house is on the older side, and perhaps needs a little TLC. The shower was quite tight and uncomfortable. These were the only downsides (but I might also be slightly pickier than most people) and easy to overlook because this apartment overall was great. And Amos was friendly and very responsive!"

I especially loved the fact that the bed was comfortable and that there were several TV apps available to guests for entertainment which was a pleasant surprise. I was there during one of our famous cold spells in NC and the unit was a little on the cold side during my stay but there was a space heater there which helped out a lot! I would definitely recommend this Airbnb and I am sure I will be back the next time business brings me back to the Durham area.

It’s very private and cozy. There were even dog bowls and a dog bed available, which I thought was so adorable and kind. Nice kitchen area that was stocked with all we needed - utensils, snacks, coffee and teas. Comfy bed, even a sound machine (I need to get one of my own now) and a nice living area with couch and tv. Amos is a very responsive and helpful host. When we’re back in town we will definitely look to stay here again! Thanks, Amos!"

Stayed with a pet","We stayed here with our two dogs for one night to see a Duke basketball game. It was good for us because we truly just needed a dog friendly spot where we could shower and rest our heads. The yard was perfect for our dogs to have some space to roam off leash and the space was great for our dogs inside as they don’t require much room. They just sleep in their beds when we aren’t around. Everything was as described. Just like other air bnbs you don’t know the cleaning required of you until you already have the spot. We were asked to strip the bed and start the load of laundry as well as clean any used dishes. Amos was helpful before, during, and after our trip with any questions/needs/concerns! Excellent host!! This place fill all of our needs for our trip."

Stayed one night","So happy to have found this Airbnb! Amos's place was close, convenient, and a fantastic deal for the price. We were in town for a night to see Wicked, and after paying for our tickets we didn't want to spend a ton on lodging, so this was a perfect find. A mile walk to the theater meant no paying for parking, and allowed us to explore all that downtown had to offer.
Amos was quick to respond, easy to talk to, and very accommodating. Check-in was a breeze and a few extra touches (water bottles in the fridge for us, Cliff and Kind bars for a little snack, the TV access) were much appreciated! Would definitely stay here again in the future."

Stayed a few nights","Exactly as described. We had a wonderful stay. Some places were walkable others were a very short drive. The place it’s self was refreshingly accurate as to the description: clean, comfortable, private entrance, had everything we needed for our short stay. The host responded very quickly to anything we needed. Honestly, we will be looking here first for booking when we decide to return to the area."

Stayed one night","Amos's place was perfect for my stay. I loved the cozy space he has set up, completely independent of the rest of the house, and with its own entrance. It is close to a bunch of stuff; I didn't have a long stay so didn't get to see everything, but I did like the Durty Bull Brewery basically right down the street. Parking was easy and instructions were clear. Amos was responsive and helpful as a host, including the house guide he put together with local suggestions for just about everything. Highly recommend!"

Stayed one night","I recently stayed at Amos' Airbnb in Durham, NC and it was a fantastic experience. The space was cozy and clean, making it the perfect home base for exploring the city. The location was great, with easy access to everything Durham has to offer.
Communication with Amos was top-notch - he was always quick to respond and made sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. He also provided us with great recommendations for things to do and see in Durham, which really made our trip.
One of the highlights of the Airbnb was the fantastic shower - it was the perfect way to unwind after a day of exploring the city. We also loved having a fridge and coffee maker in the room, which made it easy to enjoy a quick breakfast before heading out for the day.
Overall, I would highly recommend Amos' Airbnb to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay in Durham."

Stayed one night","This is an outstanding loft apartment ideally located so close to many fun spots in Downtown Durham--DPAC, restaurants, coffee shops & retail. The apartment itself is sparkling clean, comfortable queen bed, nice walk in closet with full length mirrors, nice open kitchen with all appliances: stove/oven, microwave, refrig/freezer, dishwasher, dishware & utensils, Keurig machine w/pods as well as some snacks--such a nice touch! Decorated so cool with interesting curated pieces of furniture and art. Wonderful books, puzzles and records (yes, there is even a working record player). Plenty of natural light streaming in, especially in the early evening. Nice for just sitting around before going out for the evening. Rachael is terrific at communicating. To my surprise, she got in touch with me the morning I was leaving to go over all the instructions for parking and getting in. After I had been there a couple of hours, she even came back during a working day for her, to get me back in after I accidentally locked myself out (instead of trusting my instincts to trust the code she gave me, I locked the door from the inside)--worried more about me when I was the one incoveniencing her. She couldn't have been more lovely and accommodating. I will definitely stay here next time I'm in Durham. Great place and outstanding service. Thank you Rachael."

Stayed a few nights","The hubby and I booked this airbnb for a mini-staycation to connect and relax. This airbnb felt like a home away from home and looked exactly as advertised.
As foodies, we were very surprised to have pour over coffee and French press coffee at our reach - including fresh local coffee beans, grinDer, and digital scale (things that we never bring, so we were so excited to make good coffee during out stay.
The kitchen is full stocked with essentials - pots, pans, base condiments, and more. Part of relaxing this weekend included making kimbap. If I had known there was so many kitchen essentials, I probably could have packed lighter and left certain items at home.
Riley and Gabby were very attentive and gave us stellar recommendations for dinner one night. Their guidebook is stellar, full of fun places to eat within 10 min from the location.
While it's winter, I did enjoy the screened porch and admired the natural surroundings at this tiny home.
We plan to stay here again!"

Minutes from everything and some extra tasty eats, yet it's a tranquil escape at the same time. The amenities were perfect - a fully equipped kitchen, laundry, A/C, and high-speed internet. The screened-in porch is basically the best outdoor living room in existence. The bed was sooo comfy. The kitchen felt like being right at home. I actually REALLY enjoyed the no TV element. They also pointed me to great and very well maintained walking trail at the end of their road where I enjoyed morning walks and evening runs with my pup, even saw a few deer. Also, their commitment to inclusivity and planting a tree for each visit is commendable. My stay was a delightful escape, and I'm already planning my next visit with a friend. If you want a unique and peaceful getaway, this is the place to be. Five stars for both the hosts and the home!"

Getting to the house was very comprehensive. The entrance and surroundings were giving “suburban tropical oasis”. The front porch is the cutest and perfect for yoga during the day and quaint dining during the evening. The kitchen had everything that I needed to make quick meals (I made a very impressive stove top pizza!) and the bathroom was very spacious and luxurious. The loft bedroom was very cozy. I really appreciated that all of the light and ceiling fan fixtures are labeled so I didn’t have to guess where to adjust the lights & fan. The hosts were very responsive and gave great recommendations for hiking and dining. They also gave a little “thank you” box of toffees that I delighted in when I got home later. :) This was a truly relaxing stay!"

Riley and Gaby’s home is the perfect mixture of being close to things while still feeling pleasantly secluded. And I mean, if that porch doesn’t convince you to stay here then I don’t know what will.
Their house looked exactly like it did in the pictures—if not better in person. The property was clean, thoughtfully appointed and designed, and had all the amenities one might need. And as promised, the bed and sheets were top quality.
Riley and Gaby are the epitome of ideal hosts and both went above and beyond to ensure that our stay was a comfortable and welcoming one. They went the extra mile as hosts and it showed, which makes this an easy recommendation for me.
Thanks for sharing your home with us!"

Stayed one night","What a wonderful place to be even if it was for one day. The house is wonderful and very welcoming. It was very clean and with good airflow. And the best thing for us was that it was surrounded by trees and while we were on the porch, a deer was grazing unbothered and stayed with us for a while. We are definitely planning to return and will recommend this place to our friends.
Five stars!!!!"

You have a lovely view to wake up to, quiet, and relaxing. I was happy about no tv, I wanted to get away from technology and just be where I was. The a/c worked perfectly.
This is a great vacation spot to get away for a few days. Thank you Riley for your hospitality, you are a great host."

The setting is lush, nearly tropical, not what you’d expect in suburbia. The kitchen’s well equipped, bed comfortable, plenty of towels—adding up to a wonderful stay. Lovely plus, the rattan hanging chair on the porch—I’d never sat in one before, serene experience."

Highly recommend staying here, not an in and out accomodations...get ready to make it a nice night in, I promise you'll be recharged and refreshed in no time!
I fell in love with the ambiance and design of the place. I've such a fascination with tiny homes and this spot definitely met my expectation if not more. I was so impressed!
I stayed at the tiny home the entire duration of my stay and it had everything I needed. It was quaint yet modern and so cozy and comfortable! If I have the opportunity to visit again I will!

It felt like a true escape from the city with each window giving you a perfect vantage point to the leafy woods outside. The interior layout, while tiny, is incredibly spacious with fresh, modern details, great lighting, and a fantastic porch to enjoy the outdoors. Riley and Gaby were so welcoming and communicative + especially helpful in their local recommendations, making sure we had access to everything we needed. We'd stay again in a heartbeat!"

Riley was also a VERY attentive host and super friendly. We really loved this place and are very happy with our decision to stay here! The only thing I would have preferred is if there was more of a yard space for the dog to use the bathroom, we usually had to take him for actual walks to fully do his business. Which isn’t at all an issue but definitely glad we had prepared for that with long leads and what not. Overall it was a really nice stay and Riley was a really awesome host. Bonus, we met his new rescue puppy, Lasso. Thanks for everything Riley ❤️🐾"

Stayed a few nights","Pretty Vacant is an incredible space! We stayed for my niece’s graduation and didn’t want to leave. It was the perfect place for my family to gather for a glass of wine and so incredibly charming. And, the wine bar and staff downstairs is so cute and inviting.
One thing to note is that the back patio of the wine bar is noisy (music and people chatting like the should be) until 12am on a Saturday night. It didn’t bother us upstairs because the music was sooo good and we weren’t going to bed early. But, if you are sensitive to sound or need to go to bed early, bring some ear plugs. Either way, it was 200% worth it.
Would stay here again and again.
And Sylvia had everything dialed in and is so responsive and easy-going."

Stayed one night","Once in a blue moon, you discover an AirBnB space so remarkable, so compelling, and so special, that you hesitate when it comes to sharing it with the whole wide world. Pretty Vacant is one such place.
For starters, it's named for a Sex Pistols song - that alone cranks up the hip factor exponentially. It's also located directly above an amazing wine bar and equally compelling record store. And it features a classic turntable, excellent sound system and an amazing collection of records to choose from during your stay. Indeed, we made good use of all of these resources during our stay.
Exquisite attention and care have gone into decorating Pretty Vacant, and the owner's love of the arts is apparent in every nook and cranny. We easily could have spent the night simply relaxing and relishing in Pretty Vacant's aura. In truth, we might return someday and do just that.
Silvia & Lindsay have curated a remarkable ""experience."" It's a space like no other, and worth your attention."

It's a lovely walking neighborhood, too. They were also very flexible, as we had an emergency during our stay, about checkout procedures and times. They anticipated touches that were helpful during our stay, from providing Saran Wrap to leaving Kleenex and toiletries for our use. I'd add a light, breathable (not polyester) blanket for that intermediary layer between the sheets and comforter, for visitors who like to sleep cooler. Perhaps a few hangers for skirts/pants? Glad to be able to bring our Pomeranian, Ted, on the trip; perhaps warn pet owners that dogs have to be taken out of the complex for all pee breaks (I might have missed this in your guidelines.) We hope we can stay with you again, particularly in pool-side weather. Thank you both again for your kindness and support."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I stayed at this sweet condo in Durham for three nights. Very comfortable amenities, very clean with every last detail addressed to make our stay more comfortable! I requested extra pillows on our beds and there were plenty! Robert and his team were excellent communicators-fast response to any questions.
They also offered great suggestions for local dining and attractions.
Great location! I actually took a 15 min walk to downtown to shop and felt very safe.
I would highly recommend this condo to anyone looking to stay in the Durham NC area!

There is an awesome trail entrance across the street for jogging or walking. There is wonderful chocolate shop called Cacao Canela nearby. The garden has a communal herb planter box which was amazing for roasting veggies.

Stayed with a pet","This is the fourth time we've stayed with Robert in Pearl Mill Flats, so I'm biased--this is a well-taken care of, hospitable, comfortable AirBnB with excellent hosts. It's dog-friendly and they provided a lovely floor cushion for Toby (which he really loved!). On the ground floor so there are no stairs, easy parking, excellent short walk to downtown Durham dining and nightlife. We had a minor problem w/ the lock and our host was immediately responsive. There's a nice pool, lovely outdoor spaces, and pleasant neighbors. Kind of like going to a spa, but much less expensive :)"

It is a 5 star stay with one hiccup... you have to pay a REALLY high cleaning fee and then are asked to do chores / most of the cleaning before you checkout. I am a clean and respectful person & always do my best to leave a place better than I arrived but to make it seem mandatory for you to clean with such a high fee doesn't seem fair. Hopefully the fee is lowered for the following guests or the cleaning demands are changed to respectful suggestions. I would stay here again and do recommend, just note the high cleaning fee and cleaning requirements."

Lots of nearby restaurants and bars. Space was very clean and as pictured. Good for two people. Three or four would be tight, but ok for short stay. We will try to rebook next time we are in area."

The house itself is fantastic and has all amenities I needed including some basic drink supplies like coffee and water. It also features a courtyard that is a near paradise, complete with a pool, plenty of garden space and relaxing areas, a hammock, life size chess, an artificial stream, herb garden, birds chirping everywhere.

I received a warm, friendly greeting from Ms. Gail upon my arrival.
The communication was pleasant. She responded in a timely manner to my questions, which is greatly appreciated.
Upon my arrival, there was some infrastructure work being done in front of her house by the city, which was blocking the usual parking. Ms. Gail kindly offered a temporary parking alternative.
I was impressed. The Tiny-ish Urban Oasis is exactly as pictured and described. It is charming, clean, nicely decorated, and spacious.
After long days of exploring the city, I was able to return to the Tiny-ish house and comfortably relax.
I will definitely stay again when visiting the Durham area and will highly recommend it to others.
The Tiny-ish Urban Oasis was truly my home away from home for the week."

Stayed over a week","I loved staying at the Tiny-ish House. I have always wanted to try Tiny living and was able to take advantage of Gail's hospitality for a time. I love that I was left to myself but any need was taken care of. I had my own walkway, yard, and home! I liked that I could cook and eat in the kitchen/living room space with the television. It has Netflix and you can log in to your own streaming accounts as well. The bathroom is the perfect size and the shower is a nice standup. I never had hot water issues. The bedroom was so nice with ample storage.
The location is just like the description- it is close to Golden Belt and downtown! But I loved being half a block from the lovely historic East Durham neighborhood jewel of Rofhiwa bookstore (great coffee and hot chocolate)! I really got to know the neighbors. Everyone is so nice.
As someone with a disability I highly recommend the Tiny-ish House. There are three small steps to get up into the yard but everything else is flat."

Stayed a few nights",Gail's place was central to my office for the week and her back house was just the perfect amount of cozy and functional. I was able to cook dinner there every night and relax in peace and quiet. The neighborhood has a coffee shop just a two minute walk from Gail's. THe place is also centrally located to downtown Durham and the American Tobacco Campus. Gail is so kind and communicates so well. Highly recommend this little slice of heaven if you're traveling alone or with a partner.

I was at Duke Divinity (west campus) for the week and this spot is perfect…less than 10 minutes from everything. Beautiful and ultra clean house with nice amenities and decor (and the bed is super comfy). In a great neighborhood with easy close street parking.
And Gail is SUPER responsive and helpful. She actually anticipated many of my needs…sometimes even things I didn’t know I needed! Ha! And she is crazy nice and hospitable.
I will be staying here again for all of the rest of my residential weeks!!"

She even let me park in her driveway through the duration of my stay. Her driveway is long, but narrow. So, only one car can go in/out at a time…though 2 (maybe 3) cars can fit. Generally, we had to coordinate times to see who’d park on the outside (to ensure one person’s car doesn’t trap the other’s inside)."

We're grateful that Joshua found a place for us for that one night, and we've had positive experiences with him and pleasant stays at his properties in the past.

The place looks brand new, the beds are very comfortable, and the location was very central to many of Durham’s best places. There was also an iron and an ironing board which helped us get ready for a wedding in a pinch. Highly recommend this place. Thanks, Joshua!"

Group trip",Great convenient location with EV charger. Worked great for a short stay. Everything was clean and tidy. The only disappointment is that it really doesn’t not really accommodate 6 people. The air mattress for the other 2 people has to be blown up in the middle of the living room and it comes with no quilt or quilt cover for people sleeping on the air mattress. The lights being too bright and the lack of wall decorations made it feel a little clinical.

Just a little further walk gets you to some great restaurants, shops and a nice grocery. An easy ten minute drive got me to Duke West campus.
I loved the lack of clutter! It all felt so clean - visually and physically. Desks in rooms were well used as my husband and I worked. Linens were nice and bed was comfortable.
The host was quick to respond and always really nice - from checkin to checkout.
I hope to stay here again on future visits!"

The check in process was easy and straight forward, with an access code to the door. My one criticism - and this is totally subjective - is that the apartment felt very sterile.

I love love love the location - very quiet (I am quite noise sensitive), but a straightforward walk down 9th St to restaurants and businesses in Old West Durham. A fantastic breakfast spot ""Monuts"" is a one minute walk! In general, great location for getting around.
On property, I really appreciated how thoughtfully appointed this townhome is. The kitchen had everything to make full meals (although I did not take advantage of that on this trip) and there is a pleasant lounging and dining area that felt just right.
Upstairs two bedroom suites and laundry closet (I used the washer and dryer and they were quiet, great quality appliances). The nice bonus was my bedroom suite's walk in closet so I could put my luggage out of the way.
Further, Joshua was a great host with a very responsive and cordial communication. A+++++!"

Living area spacious with a big comfortable couch an extra chair. Beds were comfortable; bathrooms well stocked with fun little amenities and plenty of towels that were fluffy and absorbent. Good hot water supply with good water pressure in the showers one of which is also a tub. Full size washer dryer definitely a plus along with the laundry pods. Quiet home, part of a townhouse, duplex style. Can’t comment on noise from next-door as no one was renting at the time. There is a house next-door that obviously rents to college students who would gather on the weekend evenings, but was never a problem, noise wise, while we were there. moderate traffic and pedestrian activity outside, but clearly of the neighborhood variety and not unreasonably loud at all. Host was super proactive and communicative. We had an issue with the door lock on our first day, and he sent someone out to fix."

Stayed a few nights","William is a super-duper host!! He went above and beyond what most folks would do. I had a family emergency and need to extended my stay. I was waiting to hear from the hospital as to when my father may undergo surgery. During this wait, I lost William's place to someone who did a quick reservation (doesn't need host approval). I got the news as I was sitting next to my very sick father in the hospital. As this was our first time in North Carolina, I wasn't sure what to do and panicked a little. As I was frantically trying to book another place, William contacted me to let me know he pleaded my case to AirBnB and the new reservation was canceled and I was able to extend my stay. This proved to be a lifesaver for my parents and me. Not only is William's place immaculate, beautifully decorated and furnished, it was also an ideal location for all of our wedding then hospital trips. I will be forever grateful to William for his kindness, patience, support and amazing hospitality."

It is evident that the area is undergoing gentrification; that being that, it was just my daughter and I and we felt very safe. The home is in close proximity to anything and everything you need. Whether you're traveling within Durham or the Chapel Hill area, I would strongly recommend the Rooftop Oasis -- it will not disappoint. William is very responsive and accommodating, we would return."

Stayed with a pet","William’s home was exactly what we had hoped for during our stay in Durham! It had all the amenities we could have needed, and is located in a great spot with easy access to lots of nearby attractions, downtown, and Duke. Unfortunately, there was ongoing construction next door during our stay, so a lack of privacy from construction workers limited our ability to use the backyard and roof deck - totally out of William’s control, and he kindly reached out to ensure our stay was as comfortable as possible. I will note, if you have a nervous dog (like we do) that you are planning on bringing, they may not fare well with the construction noise, so I would recommend checking in with William about the status of the construction before booking! Otherwise, I highly recommend this spot and would absolutely stay here again. Thanks, William!"

There was some construction going on next door, but I didn’t have any issues during my stay. William was great—he reached out to ensure I was enjoying my stay and communicated about the construction prior to my arrival. The location was great—you’re just minutes from downtown and plenty of great restaurants/bars/breweries. The neighborhood as a whole was a little scruffy, like many areas undergoing regeneration, but it wouldn’t deter me from staying here again. Overall, a positive experience!"

The place was exactly what we were looking for. Very clean and fully stocked. It appeared to be new construction. It was a nice quiet neighborhood and William was the perfect Airbnb owner/neighbor (unlike the last one we had). Other than helping us get in the first night we never saw him again, yet he responded to email promptly.
We highly recommend the place, especially if you are going to Duke University medical center as it is very convenient.
Only recommendation would be televisions in the bedrooms."

The house was clean and offered everything we needed for a comfortable stay. William was very attentive to our needs and very accommodating. There are plenty of board games to play on a rainy/cold evening. We would certainly stay again when the weather permits to enjoy the rooftop views. The beds are very comfortable.
Note: there is one television downstairs, but we were able to sign into our Netflix account. We enjoyed watching family friendly movies before bed."

Also, I enjoyed the proximity to restaurants downtown. The property was perfect for myself and one guest as it has two bedrooms and two baths. The master does not have a closet but there are several wall hangers for clothes.
Taylor and Dylan were immediately responsive to my inquiries which I very much appreciated. All in all, it was the perfect place for me to recuperate during a difficult time. Thank you Taylor and Dylan."

Stayed a few nights","PROS: Absolutely loved this house! It's in a great location and looks exactly like the pictures. The bed and couch were comfortable and the living area had natural light. It's tucked away and was very peaceful at night. It's in the heart of downtown so it's easy to walk to bars & restaurants. We LOVED the list of bars & restaurants the hosts provided!
CONS: The heat doesn't reach the primary bedroom as well so you may have to turn up the heat a bit higher at night. The shower in the primary doesn't get very hot. The water filter was also expired, slight oversight.
When I initially reached out about the possibility of an early check-in or at least some flexibility around the standard check-in time, I was met with a rigid response stating that it was not possible due to cleaning schedules. However there were no guests for the 4 days prior to our stay. I was disappointed with the lack of accommodation and service but overall happy with the property. We would definitely book again!"

Stayed about a week","Taylor & Dylan are Super Hosts. In fact, we feel that they are some of the best hosts that we have ever had on Airbnb.
Their home is darling, cozy, well appointed, and very private!
They provided constant communication, to make sure we were happy and didn't need anything.
They provided posts with great places to go while we're in town.
We love their property so much, we have shared with them that if the property is available, we will use it every time we come to town."

Every detail and finish was very well done. While we didn't use much of the kitchen, it looked well-stocked. The house was private and felt very safe. Great location and very walkable to downtown Durham. The street parking could be a tad tricky, but there was plenty of space. I'd definitely stay here again if back in the area."

We were there for 3 nights. 3 adults and we all needed to work from home one day. WiFi was great and we were able to spread out and all work without bothering each other. Clean, modern furnishings. Washer/Dryer and dishwasher. Also, they thought of little touches like coffee and sugar, oilve oil, salt and pepper, etc. A real gem. The neighborhood is totally walkable. One of us had a meeting at the main library and we were thrilled to realize it was literally around the corner. All in all, a great stay."

Stayed a few nights","I could live in Taylor & Dylan's place. Seriously. The accommodations were 5-star. So many things made it perfect for me & my family. It's now #1 place I'll look for when I'm in Durham. This place felt spacious and healthy: linens & towels free of harmful chemicals; white towels that smelled clean (people try to protect the color in colored towels by not using hot water and those towels often smell funky covered with fragrance); quality stainless steel cookware (not the scratched up, cheap teflon coated stuff in so many airbnbs); comfy mattresses and pillows; tons of natural light; a couple of windows with screens so you could get fresh air. Beautifully designed & decorated, wonderful porch, nestled among trees, nice privacy fence. The location was super convenient to downtown and everywhere I needed to be in town. Taylor & Dylan knocked it out of the park."

Beautiful wood flooring, very private and serene setting, and all new (high quality) appliances and fixtures. Of all the airbnbs I have ever stayed in, this was the one with the greatest upside surprise when I got inside the place. I wish every airbnb was as nice as this was. They were also very attentive and responsive and very much cared that I have a great experience staying at their Airbnb. 5+ Stars!"

Stayed over a week","This place was beautiful and had everything we needed for our long stay. It did feel like a hideaway close to downtown. So many squirrels and birds in the tall trees that surrounded the private little home up the driveway, made it feel private and cozy. They really put a lot of love into this place to make it look beautiful. The only thing I missed was having an actual work space. Two people working on the dinning room table for 2 weeks wasn't ideal, but we made it work. Also, although the livingroom furniture was beautiful it wasn't actually comfortable for watching TV when we wanted to relax. Communication was great and fast, although it seemed like we were always communicating with someone different. That said, I would definitly recommend it and would definitly be back."

It can be tough to find at night although the hosts did give really good instructions. I did hear some noise from upstairs but it wasn't a big deal or enough to deter me from staying here again. You can tell that the hosts put a lot of effort into making this place comfortable for their guests.

Stayed one night","Pros: Nice accommodations, lots of very sweet extras. Place was very clean and welcoming. Area felt very safe! The little touches Jacqueline provides were very nice and heartwarming and you can see she goes the extra mile for sure!!!!
Cons: It is located below a residence and you can hear foot traffic above. Not in a terrible way but just something to note. Also because it is the lower level of a residence and in a woodsy area it is definitely damp and somewhat musty. Again, not terrible but it did slightly aggravate my allergies.
Overall a very good stay!"

My sister and I were seeing a concert at the Carolina Theatre which was only a short drive away with lots to do in that area. It was a perfect location and great stay. Jacqueline was even nice enough to mail my sisters sweater when she forgot it. If you need a nice place to stay that has great hosts this is a good location!"

Stayed one night",Jacqueline's Bird's Nest was so well equipped and decorated. We have stayed in many Airbnbs over the years and I believe she had the most well stocked bathroom and linens of any. She communicated immediately and her husband was very nice. We did walk around the neighborhood and look at all the beautiful houses. it was easy to get to the Duke campus and most other spots. A good value for money.

The outdoor patio space was truly wonderful for working and eating in the mornings and early evenings around the conference I was in town for. The hosts were easy to communicate with and even went out of their way to make sure I recovered some luggage I left behind. Absolutely recommend!

This is a basement apartment with easy parking, nice spaces inside and out, and very close to much of what I wanted to do. The one thing I learned that I didn't see mentioned in other reviews, is that the many cool metal pieces of art and furniture inside and out result from Jackie being a welder! She recommended a fun place she used to work - Cricket Forge - which I visited and really enjoyed! She and her husband have worked hard to make this place personal and special."

There are a number of restaurants within a mile or so. You are near the Duke campus, and there is a park just a few minutes away, walking.
There were snacks and a number of additional products such as toiletries available for my use. This was very nice and special and generous. Everything that I needed was there plus more.
Jackie was super attentive to details and offered to get me whatever I needed.
Jackie helped me adjust my dates and was always available for any questions. I needed a carrot peeler and she brought me one right away. It was a nice, super sharp one.
The Airbnb is located below Jackie and her family’s home. It was a very nice, quiet and comfortable space."

The bed was very comfy and I even took a nap on the couch it was comfy as well! The apartment was very well stocked plus I did wash a load of clothes. Super cute bathroom, the shower was a little small but worked fine for me just had to get used to it! I had some trouble sleeping because my dogs were reactive (barking/upset) towards the dogs upstairs just walking around or playing late at night. So if you have a reactive or high alert dog keep that in mind!! Overall a really great host, great living space, and would definitely return again!"

Stayed a few nights","Thanks to our hosts for everything! They addressed any issues right away, and have so many little 'extras' that made our stay feel more luxurious and personal. Currently there is no hand rail for the short group of stairs getting up to the front door, so if you are a senior, you'll want to take that into consideration.
Overall, we really loved our stay at the Birds Nest! Great value and great location to everything."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I were in town for the weekend to attend a show at the Durham Preforming Arts Center. The Bird’s Nest was the perfect location! It was near DPAC, many great restaurants, and parks. The apartment had wonderful amenities for a short stay. The hosts provided complimentary snacks and an assortment of toiletries in case you forget anything. The WiFi was fast, and Netflix was provided on both TVs. Our golden retriever traveled with us as well, and The Bird’s Nest was very pet friendly. Communication with Jacqueline was detailed and informative. We fell in love with Durham and will definitely stay at The Bird’s Nest the next time we’re in town!"

We had a long day of driving from NJ, and sleeping on that comfy bed gave us a good sleep and we recovered fully the next day. Yes, we will check in again if we come back to this area."

Stayed a few nights","Though there’s been great attention given to small touches, when you enter the home there is a distinct, malodorous smell. They try to mask with a very strong, floral scent. The website description that you have the entire house to yourself is not accurate. This is the downstairs of a home, a basement apartment.The upstairs is rented so there are people and a small dog walking across the floor. The furnace for the house is located in the bedroom, so it is noisy at night."

Stayed with a pet",Jaqueline’s place was the ideal location for our quick overnight trip to Durham. It’s located within a quick drive to many lovely restaurants and shops. There’s a lovely deck right outside the door where we got to soak up some sun. Jaqueline was communicative and responded to all messages promptly and even allowed us to do an early check-in when we got to town sooner than expected. The apartment was clean and tidy for our arrival. My only issue was that the bed wasn’t the most comfortable for me because I have some problems with my joints and it seemed to be exacerbated by the bed. It might be something to consider if you’re a person with similar challenges. Overall it was a great stay and I would definitely recommend!!

Stayed one night",The location is safe and convenient and the host is friendly and informative. There are definitely a lot of extras and conveniences available with this rental. During our stay we struggled with a strong mal odor in the apartment and several cleanliness issues - since we were only there one night we decided not to pursue it with the owner during our stay and perhaps these will be addressed before future guest visits.

Stayed with a pet","Our stay at The Bird’s Nest was great! The original plan was to use it as a place to crash while exploring Durham for the rest of the weekend, but we were snowed in for most of our trip. Thankfully, this was a great space to be snowed in to! We had everything we needed- and more. This was the first Airbnb I have stayed in that provided so many things to do (crossword puzzles, sudoku, magazines), and so many “in case you forgot” (cotton balls, band aids, floss, and even a face mask!) items. The towels were fluffy and plentiful! I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone visit the Raleigh Durham area."
