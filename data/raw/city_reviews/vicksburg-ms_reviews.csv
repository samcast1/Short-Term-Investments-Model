Stayed with kids","This is a really cool spot! I’ve been to Vicksburg many times, but having such a great base in such a great spot made it memorable. The condo is clean and spacious and just all around really neat. The balcony was perfect at night as the sun set and the street lights turned on. Tyler’s place is walking distance from most of the museums and best restaurants in town. My boys, 9 & 11, had room to play and my wife really appreciated the big tub after a couple of days marching around the hilly streets and the military park. Tyler was very responsive and helpful. I am thankful for his suggestions about places to eat and things to do. Next time we’re in town there is no doubt where we’ll be staying!"

Stayed a few nights","Tyler's place really exceeded our expectations! He provided very clear instructions via video on how to find and enter the condo. It is very centrally located to all the cute shops on Washington street and is still a very quiet place to stay. It has a cool, modern vibe and we appreciated that the lighting could be varied from regular lighting to red for nighttime. The beds were very comfortable in each of the ensuite bedrooms and we appreciated having a bathtub in one of the bathrooms for soaking. The washer and dryer worked great and it was so nice to have the use of them. Tyler was instantly responsive when we reached out to him with questions a couple of times. We expect to return to Vicksburg in the future and will hope to be able to stay at the condo again. It was fantastic all the way around!"

He even had a video of driving directions to his place and how to get in! It was so helpful as it gave you a visual of the surroundings. Especially helpful for our friends we booked it for, as they were not familiar with the area.
The lighting, the views, the accommodations, just everything was as described and perfect!

Tyler was very welcoming and communication was top notch. The loft was just as described. Beautifully decorated. Spacious and clean. Short distance from the highway. Walkable to great restaurants, shops and the river for a gorgeous sunset. Our favorite part was being able to sit out on the balcony and watch our two-year wave at the cars as they drive by.
This is the place that defines Airbnb!"

In five minutes we could be walking or cycling in the Vicksburg National Military Park which encourages walkers, runners and cyclists. All area attractions were within a 10-20 minute drive. Evenings were peaceful and relaxing at the cottage. The kitchen and linen closet are stocked for settling in for a while. We appreciated the convenience of all kitchen appliances, washer/dryer, crock pot, electric frying pan, electric mixer, and more. The living room furniture is comfortable. The wifi is strong and reliable. (If you plan to work from Sky Cottage, bring along an ethernet cable for even stronger connection.) Host Mary Ann added touches that made for a comfortable stay. We recommend this cottage for a short or an extended stay. We hope to return next year."

Stayed a few nights",We were three adults. Father and two grown adults (son & daughter). We chose this BNB to be close to the Battlefield park for bike riding. In that respect the location was great. The house is small and somewhat retro - which was to our liking. The beds were comfortable. We shared the one small bathroom without any inconvenience. The kitchen is small and not what you want if you are a real cook but it suited us just fine. Ice trays furnish the ice. The neighborhood is friendly and quiet. You can walk or in our case bike into the park at the end of the road. There is only one concern. There is a 6 inch or so step down from the living area into the larger bedroom. It presented some concern when navigating in the dark. I have suggested a night light or stair light. For our purposes and lifestyle (we eat out) it was great. The bottom line is that we would certainly stay there again and we recommend it.

We are old friends 30 and meet to catch up, laugh about old times. Honestly we've been known to sit at the kitchen table all day. But this time we had beautiful patio in the woods and wonderful weather. Lovely cocktails and a friend sweet dog, Jolene who welcomed us with warm eyes and an inquisitive look. The Wisteria was wonderful. it lightly scented air and added to the experience. The kitchen is well stocked as we do cook. The bedroom was comfortable plenty of towels and blankets. We never left during our stay. We have decided to put this hidden gem on repeat and return at least spring and fall."

The only ""negative"" is that it is listed as a lakeside cottage. It is really an apartment built into the end of a large metal building, and it is not lakeside. The lake is within walking distance though, and is pretty. We did not use the pool but it attached to the host's home which is a brick home a stone's throw from the pictured porch. While we pictured something a bit more private, we still enjoyed our stay there and came away refreshed. I highly value comments when choosing a place and just wanted the next person to understand what to expect."

Stayed a few nights","This Vicksburg Airbnb was a lovely place to stay, in a quiet wooded neighborhood away from the noise and busyness of nearby Vicksburg. It was a pleasant 20+ minute drive to town for restaurants, grocery stores and historic areas. We especially enjoyed revisiting the Vicksburg National Military Park, and also the Walnut Hill restaurant, both of which we have been to several times as we have passed through the area on driving trips.
Everything was very clean, convenient and well-supplied. The decorating was lovely, with all kinds of interesting touches. We didn’t have a chance to use the pool, but it looked lovely.
It’s a small detail, but we really appreciated having two luggage racks, so that neither of us had to have a suitcase on the floor. We wish all hosts would supply luggage racks, an easy and inexpensive convenience.
This Airbnb is a really good choice for a couple to stay at while visiting the historic Vicksburg area."

Group trip","loved the location felt very safe very homey super comfortable bed we had 5 adults (ages 22- 55) staying there and I would say it is probably well suited for 2 to sleep comfortably as there is only one bed if there are young people or adults who do not mind a sofa bed the one there is equipped with linens, etc. There is a twin blow up mattress in the bedroom closet that would be perfect for a child to sleep on. Overall, we were very satisfied as the location was lovely and our crew enjoyed the pool. The home felt like ""home"""

Pictures are a bit misleading but like I said, maybe I misread where it said the pool was separate. You can still walk across to it and can swim until 9pm. Host was very friendly and the cottage was pristine. Comfortable and supplies with everything needed."

Stayed with kids","This cottage was a gem of a find!! We were passing through on our way home, and after hours of driving, this was like a home from home. Everything was clean and tidy. The kids and I went out to swim for a couple of hours and had a blast. There were plenty of swim floats, toys, and accessories to keep them busy. The shower and water pressure were great!! The bed was extra comfortable, and there were plenty of extra pillows and blankets for the kids who slept on the pull out couch comfortably. We loved all the games and played Monopoly before we went to bed. There were both Keureg and traditional filters with coffee grounds available with cream and sugar, which we gladly enjoyed before leaving in the morning. Wished we had more time to explore the trail and lake but hoping to visit again on our travels through in the future!! We definitely recommend, thank you Lisa and Fred for such a great stay!!"

I enjoyed sitting in the little window-seat nook with a book and cup of tea. We appreciated that we could have our dog with us, and the floors inside are perfect for pets! The hosts are very friendly and interested in making sure you have a great experience! We hope to stay again on another trip through the Vicksburg area."

My kids enjoyed swimming in the pool and playing with Jolene their little dog and petting the cat. You can see the stars at night because it's out in the country and hear the sounds of bullfrogs and crickets as you fall asleep. Next time we will try to stay longer to explore the lake!"

Stayed with a pet","If you are looking for a quiet, beautiful home to enjoy, this is the gem to stay! We wanted something secluded in a quiet place that was not too far from town and we found just that. I’m an avid airbnb booker and have stayed at many locations in many states and my Husband and I felt this has been one of the best experience thus far. We live busy lives and are always looking for those hidden gem areas with charm, historyand serenity.
This was our first experience bringing our pup and by far an amazing opportunity was created by not only the hosts but their pup too! He had the freedom to roam and play with their pup as well and it made the experience even easier as many pup owners know how limited and restrictive travel with animals can be. The serenity came in the form an immaculate cottage stay, pool access& also the many animal sounds heard throughout the wooded area.
Lisa was so friendly and helpful with everything! (Our first encounter with owners & they were so accommodating!)🩵"

They gave us the option to cancel or offered to run the cottage off of a generator. We showed up to a comfortably cool cabin and special touches like fresh muffins and fruit for breakfast. They made us feel like we were at home and the location was the perfect halfway point to stop on our way to Gulf Shores. I will definitely be back as their place is so much more comfortable than stopping at a hotel…and the location is beautiful!

They provided the most comfortable stay we've ever encountered. The amount of extra pillows, blankets, towels, & toiletries are one of the many things that makes us so grateful we didn't have to worry. They made sure the TV was connected/ready and that we had ample toilet paper when we got there, which are basic needs that surprising are rare to find in other Airbnbs. The kitchen was divine with everything we needed and more. We had a medical emergency which made us leave early, Lisa and Fred made the defining effort of wishing us healing and safety when we left, that made us feel like they are absolute angels. What a sanctuary!"

Stepping into the cottage we felt welcome and able to unwind and relax after a day full of driving. Our family of five fit perfectly for an overnight stay. The kiddos used the sofa bed and an air mattress in the living room. We appreciated the extra amenities provided -- the fully equipped kitchen along with welcome snacks, and plenty of extra towels, etc., and sheets, etc. Wish we had longer to stay -- I would have taken advantage of the exercise mat and weights and would have loved to bike around the lake described in the listing. Definitely recommend!"

Stayed with a pet","Upon arrival we immediately noticed the infestation of bee's and wasps. They actually live in the door frame of the entrance to the unit , as well as the rafters and siding of unit . The lake is quite the hike and we had to drag the provided kayaks on an obstacle course to get them to the lake, although we did inform them of our plans of kayaking before we arrived Very little effort was made to make our kayaking experience enjoyable.They did however,bring the kayaks to the unit in a travel cage . But were left in the cage for us to unload . The life jackets were not provided until the end of the day . After we were done kayaking . This was a trip for just my granddaughter and myself, so all the heavy lifting and dragging was quite a burden .The photos they posted were misleading, I was expecting a lake view from the unit .There was only trees no view of the lake unless you hiked to the lake.The lake was cut off by a road so it was more like a large pond UUM ..The weather was great"

It is very Professionally Crafted, attached to the shop but you would never know it once you are inside: it’s beautifully crafted, well, appointed and maintained, with a large furnished terrace, located in a Lovely Spacious Location Filled With Nature and near a small lake. Lots of Nature sights and Sounds to Sooth the Soul. Lisa is a Responsive Host and you have the Use of the pool. Her Dog and kitty are Very sweet and love attention if you want some Animal Love 💕🐾🐾❤️

There could not have been a better balm from a rough day than this place. I only wish we'd been able to stay longer! The kitchen is huge and has everything you could need, the shower has two heads and tons of pressure, perfection after my day. Communication was great, and the place was perfect for my allergies to scents and bleaches. Decorations were just right, and there was something for everyone - even yoga mat and weights. The woods behind patio are so peaceful. I could not recommend a place more."

Great hosts that communicated well and although we didn’t see them in person, we felt we could reach out to them for help if we needed it.
Having lived in the Vicksburg area before, my wife and I didn’t need any help with amenities or things to do, but again, I felt the hosts would have helped us if we’d needed help.

The house was just like the pictures, spacious, welcoming and accommodated our family, even our 4 legged little girl. It is on a beautiful lake in a rural area,a good distance from stores so come prepared with your food and other personal items. Lynne and Paul did leave a tray of snacks and bottled water to welcome us. Interacting with them was like communicating with old friends. I would definitely like to stay again if in the area."

Stayed with kids","Swannie's At Eagle Lake was a great space and the view from the living room window looking at the lake was fantastic. There were lots of extras that made the stay easy to do with small children like a high chair, toddler bed, and packnplay. Lynn and Paul had nice touches like chips, coffee, coloring books/chalk, & toys in addition to the standard things like toiletries and cleaning supplies. The beds and furniture were comfortable! The place will really come together for fishing when the dock is repaired. We tried fishing off the small boat ramp, but the way the water was moving, there was brush that made it not ideal.
Lynn & Paul were great hosts. They were super responsive and even made inquiries on our behalf to help answer a few questions I had before the stay! If you’re looking for a peaceful place away from the rush of everyday, this is your place."

Stayed with a pet","Let me put it this way..... If you think this might be the place you've been looking for, then let me tell you, it is. I used this location to plan my wife a secret 30th birthday party. I invited friends and family from nearby states to come visit, and the location could not have been more perfect for the event. From the exquisite kitchen and patio for cooking and grilling all weekend, to the massive downstairs room with the 70 inch TV that was perfect for gathering everyone to showcase a video I made of all her friends and family who couldn't make it wishing her a happy birthday, to spending time out on the lake. It was the top of my list as far as AirBnB experiences have gone, and I would love to come back again one day. It helped that Lynn and Paul were EXTREMELY responsive, helping with every question that I had, and even recommended a place to hae a custom cake ordered which turned out delicious. Everything about this trip was fantastic."

Even though i booked late Friday amber responded immediately with professionalism and a friendly southern charm. Definitely owe a huge thank you to amber for making an Already good evening even better for my date & I.

Stayed one night","We were travelling between Fort Worth and Augusta GA. Vicksburg was a great place to stop and we knew of several great restaurants on Washington St., but the stop was spur of the moment and was for only one night. Tough for an Airbnb booking, but amber stepped up. The room we wanted to book was not ready but she put us into a larger suite and on short notice got the room ready for us even though it was 9PM when we arrived! She went above and beyond. Her instructions were clear. The street that fronts the building is small and narrow but there is parking at the building, which was fully occupied so we parked on that small street with no trouble. There is a nice porch you can look out on the river and the shops and restaurants are right around the corner. The space itself has a comfortable bed. The kitchen seems well appointed. It all looked very new, so no coffee, salt pepper etc. I would check with Amber if you need something stocked. great space and host!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a very clean (cleanest place we have ever stayed) and beautiful little place. If you love old looking buildings, you will love this place. The host supplied menus of all the restaurants in town. There is an axe throwing/bar establishment on the first floor and everyone there was very helpful. On Saturday, we were trying to find a place to watch a college game. The manager of the axe throwing/bar said they didn’t have the networks for the game but told us to comeback and she would have that game on that we were wanting to watch. When we came back at game time, she had it on. After the game we got to talking to one of the employees and he gave us a list of things available to do on Sunday. As tourist, it would have been nice to see the stores open on Sunday, but I appreciate the fact that they weren’t. It wasn’t a show stopper though. I would definitely recommend this place. Thanks Amber, we loved your place!!"

Amber, her partner, the residents and staff were so nice and accommodating. One hiccup was the wifi but in their defense it worked fine when Mark came to fix it but as soon as he left I couldn't access it anymore. I decided to just let it go and use my phone's wifi. I also suggest you bring your own throw if you are like me and like to snuggle under a blanket while watching TV. Other than that everything was great. Oh and be prepared for stairs but without them you don't get the wonderful view. I totally recommend them and will not hesitate to use them again."

Location was ideal for me, someplace quiet and private, and someplace where I could rest easy before another day of driving. The property is located a short distance from Interstate IH-20, and the neighborhood is cute and safe. The guesthouse is comfortable and well maintained; really appreciated the effort that Kyle made to give the guesthouse an African Safari feel. The kitchen was stocked with all the basics and more (spices, condiments, coffee, tea, creamer, honey, etc.). Also enjoyed visiting with the chickens, bees and rabbits at the little farm out back. I can 100% recommend and hope to stay again soon!"

Actually, we wanted to take a look around the city, but decided to stay in the cabin and enjoy the peace. The cabin was clean and with everything you need. Guests are lovingly cared for. The pictures don't quite correspond to reality, it's much nicer than it's shown on AirBnB. We would come back anytime, also longer than for one night."

Stayed one night","This is not Kyle's fault, it is my fault for not looking at the pictures, but there were 5 huge animal heads in the apartment. Yikes.
Ok, but it was still worth it. The price was 50% of other airbnbs. And, this was the only one with 5 stars for cleanliness. If I could give it 10 stars, I would. It was beautiful and perfectly clean and private and super well-stocked. Kyle thought of everything. I don't cook but a great chef could have had everything they needed to make a great meal.
I never could turn on the TV but I was only there one night so that was ok. It was a super comfortable bed and bedding.
I recommend you walk around the property. There was a stunning pond with 3 swans! And, there were chickens and roosters and rabbits.
I recommend it highly. Kyle was very nice too and was flexibile with check-out! Thank you, Kyle."

Out of Africa had comfy beds, amazing hot water and was the best place to recharge your mind! If you love the quiet setting of the country and like to enjoy your coffee on a the porch... this is the place for you! Plus Kyle recommended an phenomenal restaurant in town to have dinner at. This is definitely my go to place from now on when I am in Vicksburg, MS."

The only other cocern was that a battery in one of the smoke alarm kept churping, but I'm sure he has taken care of that it was our lastnight so he jad no time to addtess it while we were there.

We have family in the area and will be staying again as we have big family gatherings and this gives us our own space to relax in the evenings. Perfect location as it’s convenient to so much. We are used to travel and keep a go container that holds all the necessary things. House was well stocked and we needed very little out of our go container.

Stayed a few nights","House is clean and easy to find, and in close proximity to most attractions around Vicksburg. Check in was smooth, and we never had to text James for anything. He was always ahead of the game with the information needed.
The home is older, but well maintained. It has several window unit style air conditioners, which allows everyone to set the temp of their rooms to their comfort level.
We did have to go get our own toilet paper, paper towels, coffee filters and bath soap and shampoo. I don't know if that was an oversight on the housekeeping, but it wasn't a deal breaker.
Our family of four enjoyed a 5 night stay. The beds were comfortable, and linens in good shape. Our oldest son is a chef, and he prepared a nice meal one night in the kitchen, and he had everything he needed.
We highly recommend this property!"

Even the closets were wall papered and decorated. The laundry room area is beautiful. Detergent pods are provided which is also nice when you’re traveling to be able to do laundry. The bed was comfy and had a really warm fluffy comforter. We had some issues with the hot water in the shower but the host was very responsive and helped give us some tips to fix it. The driveway is really long which was nice for us to be able to park our truck and boat. It’s a beautiful cozy home and if you love home decor, you will love the attention to detail in this house. We were just passing through so we only stayed a night, and didn’t get to enjoy the back yard but it has a beautiful seating area outside. You will feel right at home at this house."

The TV is a smart TV but when trying to download YouTubeTV it asked for a pin to allow downloads and the owners didn’t know the pin so we were unable to watch TV other than Prime.

You will definitely need a car. If you want to prepare food, note that the kitchen is fairly basic and we had to ask for a few more items, but Rachel was kind enough to bring them over which was appreciated. Hopefully the kitchen can be restocked with a few more things to make a longer stay more comfortable. The house could do with a little bit of TLC which would really set it apart as it's a quiet and great location with a lot of space."

No networks on the TV (so football for Hubby was not accessible), but still had access of personal Netflix account.

We had a minor problem the night of with the hot water, but they responded that morning, because it was very late when we discovered this issue, and came over very quickly to adjust it. Rachel was very easy to communicate with. Mosquitos were really bad in general so bring bug spray."

It’s a little too far to walk into downtown on a hot summer’s day, but just off of Washington St. and fairly convenient. We appreciated the long driveway for parking, keyless entry, and comfortable bed.
If you’re like us, and like to actually use the kitchens at your Air BnB’s, this one was fairly well stocked with pots and pans, knives, and even an array of spices.
We enjoyed this little home away from home and greatly appreciated Rachel being willing to adjust our check-out time for a more casual last morning. Thanks, Rachel!"

I really enjoyed the claw foot bath tub, my bed, the lounging area in the back and the vodka and ice in the freezer. I was hoping to stay for two nights, but knew one was a possibility and Rachel was flexible with my slow decision making process. I travel to Vicksburg once a year and hope to stay at Rachel's in the future."

The apartment is up a long flight of stairs above the carriage house, and it was very comfortable. There's a lot of work being done in the yard and adjacent house. I was sightseeing in the area and the apartment suited my purposes fine."

Looking for a quiet and comfortable stay we found Nicole's place. It was wonderful. She has done a great job creating a comfortable space with all amenities above her garage. Her ""locals"" guide was full of suggestions on local restaurants. We visited the 10 South Riverfront Bar and Restaurant for drinks and an appetizer with sweeping views of town and the rivers below. Next was dinner at Rusty's with an extensive menu and good homemade desserts. At both we tried the fried green tomatoes, and were excellent! Nicole was an absolute joy to interact with. Fantastic host."

The kitchen was stocked with everything needed to cook a Christmas dinner. The apartment is on the 3rd level. But no worries! There is an elevator, so it was very easy to get our things up there! The views from the roof top patio were gorgeous!
The sunsets are a must see!!
So, if you are looking for that perfect place to stay while in Vicksburg, I highly suggest staying with Chris!

Stayed a few nights","The loft is perfectly located to enjoy the many interesting sights in the historic downtown area and Vicksburg National Military Park. Several very good restaurants within walking distance and wonderful shops to explore.
The loft and rooftop terrace are as described and offer all the perks and quirks of a +145 year-old building set amongst other historic structures. The rooftop terrace offers spectacular sunset views and occasional vessels travelling up and down the river. The art gallery below has many cool pieces, so be sure to spend time there too!
The host, Chris, and the gallery employees are amazingly friendly and helpful with touring and dining recommendations. It's like having your personal concierge.
Our only negative (and the reason we rated the property a 4) is there is construction underway on the floor above the loft. The host has taken many precautions to minimize any impact to guests - such as limiting work hours and keeping a clean job site (since you go through it to get to the rooftop terrace) - but sometimes there are inconveniences. We feel the construction project should have been disclosed at time of booking."

The kitchen is very well stocked, the walk-in shower is large, the heat works great (it was 20’s & 30’s during our visit), and did I mention that the loft is clean? Clean feet after wood floors? Never...but in the loft, clean feet! Comfy bed and pillows. The rooftop is awesome too. My only criticism: the WiFi is slow. We could never get more than about 8mbps down, but we streamed Netflix A-Ok. Could’ve been tough if I’d needed to work.
We’d ABSOLUTELY return. The gallery manager downstairs was incredibly friendly, responsive, and gave some great recommendations.
We always felt safe, comfortable, and this may be the cleanest AirBNB I’ve ever stayed in!"

So much better than a hotel."

We spent almost the whole night on the roof just relaxing, listening to good music, playing the ukulele and enjoying each other’s company. The studio was right in the middle of everything. A very distance to many restaurants, coffee shops and shopping.
Many times Airbnb stays can feel pretty impersonal but H.C. Porter bleeds from the walls and is undeniable without feeling like we were intruding. It was so welcoming that we felt like we were visiting a really awesome family member. We left with a piece of artwork to take home as well to commemorate our anniversary and can’t wait to hang it up in our house.
We will definitely be coming back!"

There are only two beds (enough to fit 2) and couches and 1 slider. An unusual “event fee” was increased the week of my stay. It was originally $35 but the host increased it to $150 after I already made a full payment. Unfortunately I did not have any other options so I paid it without complaining.
Once again this place was beautiful and it’s best feature is the rooftop and the beautiful artwork."

Stayed a few nights","This is a wonderful space in a charming small town. It's a vast, high-ceilinged loft with columns, tall windows, and sophisticated decor, mostly of Mississippi artists, including the owner. Everything was very comfortable, clean and of high quality. We were able to go up to the wonderful rooftop terrace, pleasantly rugged and comfortable, with views over the river. The host and her assistant, who is also the gallery manager, were very helpful and kind, suggesting local restaurants. The only reservation for staying here is just that it would be difficult for people who cannot walk easily, as it is necessary to walk upstairs to the loft, and further up to the roof. Otherwise, there could be a better place to stay."

We also loved visiting Captain Tom's wood shop, Lorelei's Books and The Strand (for community theater or movies).

This is definitely the most unique and stylish location I have ever stayed in from Airbnb and one of the most spectacular ever. The location (downtown Vicksburg) could not be better. I was able to park my car on the street and then just walk to shops, restaurants and many sightseeing venues. Communication before hand was exceptional. I knew exactly who would meet us at the gallery and exactly when. The young man who met us was prompt, helpful (helped take our luggage upstairs) and knew a lot about the area. He gave us all the particulars on the loft and gave us all the information Chris had left in the loft. The loft is well marked - wifi, private areas, ac, alarm system.....There is a full kitchen and as a bonus The Miss Mississippi Pagent parade was Monday night. We bought frozen catered food from down the street and prepared it in the kitchen. We ate in and watched the parade from the windows! We were not able to utilize the balcony space as it was too hot. However, a trip in the fall or spring might be necessary! The loft was exactly as promised - I cannot stress that enough. Amenities are plentiful, wifi, cable, full bath with an awesome shower and for this time of the year a phenomanal ac! This loft is a must rental for anyone visiting Vicksburg!"

Stayed one night",Beatiful place; Sam arrived on time to open on Sunday. Grabbed sandwiches from McAlisters and enjoyed sunset on deck with wine. Little street noise in AM but OK as we had early departure. One of best places we stayed on 14 day trip!

Stayed a few nights","The host's agent Sam was responsive and kept in touch with us on the road to coordinate check in. She welcomed us warmly and efficiently acquainted us with the apartment and neighborhood. The apartment is just lovely, beautifully furnished and comfortable. The old-town street is gentrified and there are interesting places to visit nearby on foot. The view over the river bend from the roof is magnificent."

Stayed one night","The loft is absolutely amazing! The atmosphere was warm and elegant, and it's conveniently located near restaurants, shops and attractions...within walking and driving distance. We are definitely looking forward to returning soon."

Stayed one night","Really lovely flat. We thought the photograph might have been taken with a wide angle lens but we were wrong the loft is huge! It was also extremely clean, tidy and comfortable."
