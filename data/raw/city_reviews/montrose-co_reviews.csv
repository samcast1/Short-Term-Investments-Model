Stayed over a week","Came to montrose for the Ouray ice festival and doing some ice climbing. this place was a great home away from home. the kitchen had everything. Safeway was down the street. felt really like home. loved the furniture and decorations too.
neighborhood was quiet and safe. not much happening in Montrose. but it was quite accessible to get to ouray, telluride, Mt sneffels, and black canyon.
thanks for the stay! would recommend it for next year!"

Stayed a few nights","This is one of the best Air BnB’s I have stayed in. It is spacious and I can see why this would be a great extended stay. The apartment is öber clean. The kitchen cabinets (and there are a lot) are labeled so you don’t have to hunt for what you need. The nights were chilly in October, but the heat never kicked on, so it must be well insulated. Laundry facilities are a plus. A Safeway Market is nearby. We came to visit the Black Canyon of the Gunnison, an easy drive from here. I would definitely stay here again next time I am in Montrose."

We spent most of the day outside and didn’t mind the small living room. We also very much appreciated the updated and well-equipped kitchen to cook meals in. We came to see Black Canton/Telluride so didn’t really spend time in Montrose but highly recommend the town’s drive-in movie theater!

The space was so comfortable and homey, impeccably clean and stylish.
The whole place is thoughtfully furnished for convenience and comfort. The kitchen especially was intuitively laid out with all the amenities we needed to cook - oven, stove, microwave, toaster, automatic coffee maker, tea kettle, good knives and cutting board, pans, dishes, mugs, wine glasses, etc.
The host is super attentive, made sure we had fresh creamer and coffee, and even came and salted the stairs after a snow/winter-mix storm blew through.
We are grateful for such a great find, and we look forward to returning!"

May not be a preference for some (for those who aren't looking to stay in a neighborhood, but more out in the rural), but when doing a lot of traveling, especially on the road a lot in one day, coming to this place at days end was a nice treat. All the amenities you need and sofa and bed were clean. Cat also gave some recommendations on local food eateries in and around town. Will definitely keep this place in mind if I'm back this way again."

We visit Montrose to see our son and grandkids and have used hotels and a couple of other Airbnb locations in the past. Going forward we hope to only use Cat's Airbnb when we come in to Montrose to stay as it was by far the best experience and the most comfortable stay; we could enjoy our time with our grandkids in the spacious living room and it was just really perfect!

Cat was quick to respond with communications, receptive to feedback regarding the comfort of the mattresses (which she said she’s looking into), and overall very sweet and kind. 5 stars we recommend if you’re looking for a place that gives you great privacy, is only a 5 minute drive to whatever you may need, and has access to quick walkable parks/playgrounds.

There are games to play which makes it more lively to stay.

Stayed a few nights","Nice little home with everything you could possibly need for a short or long term stay. Lots of nice personal touches have been added for your comfort and enjoyment. It’s a great location for visiting the region with Telluride, Ouray, Grand Mesa, and The Black Canyon of the Gunnison all within 30-90 minutes. And we especially enjoyed relaxing on the back patio after spending the day exploring. We would stay here again if we ever return to the area."

Stayed with a pet","Mike and Cat were amazing hosts! This particular trip back home to Montrose was a last minute one due to the recent passing of my Grandfather. My mom accompanied me on this trip and she had nothing but good things to say about her experience as well. I was able to bring my dog, which really made things easier so I didn't have to plan someone to watch him back home. Mike and Cat made the stay very enjoyable considering the circumstance. They were very responsive and if I had any questions, due to this being my first airbnb, they had answers. They even made chili and corn bread on one of the nights, which was delicious. Definitely hosts I would consider on another trip back to visit family in Montrose."

Stayed a few nights","Cat and Mike were absolutely fantastic. We stayed in their AirBnb over the New Year while they were also there and barely heard/saw them. When we did encounter each other throughout the days, it was a pleasure chatting with them about the area and playing with their adorable pup ❤️
The house itself felt like a home away from home, and being musicians we were thrilled to find a piano and 12-string guitar waiting to be played! Another bonus is the massive flat screen and reclining couch to watch a movie while you eat; and if you want to cook, they have supplied EVERYTHING you need in a kitchen to cook an extravagant meal.
The decor is minimalistic yet charming, not too much not too little. Lots of play room for our own pup and a beautiful fenced backyard to hang out in (if its not 5°!). The home was spotless when we arrived 👍
I would highly recommend staying with Cat and Mike should you decide to visit Colorado, they are wonderful people and will accommodate you greatly! When my girlfriend and I decide to return to that amazing state, this will be the place we choose to stay! 🥰"

Stayed one night","We had a great stay at Michael's bungalow. The location was convenient to coffee shops and restaurants in Montrose and the neighborhood was quiet with easy street parking. The house is very comfortable and clean. It had everything we needed for our short stay. We did not have a need for the kitchen while we were there, but it had new appliances that would be ideal for anyone looking to cook. Michael was helpful and communicative throughout our stay. He sent ample information ahead of time to make sure we had everything we needed to check in easily and we arrived to some welcome snacks he'd provided. We had a late request for a later check out and he very kindly accommodated us. Montrose does not have a ton of affordable options for travelers and Michael's place is definitely a great option for anyone looking for something cozy and spacious!"

We would have initially booked something like this over the hotel but the prices in this area are... insane. We didn't pay this much for a house in Hawaii!

So it was quite convenient for our week since we ended up visiting all three places. We wish the fridge could get colder though.

Stayed a few nights","We had a very nice stay at this property which is pretty much exactly as described and pictured. The house is comfortable, well equipped, and is in a fairly good location. Street parking is plentiful, and the neighborhood seems nice enough. The house was VERY clean, and the kitchen had everything we needed to prepare meals each day. Michael's communication is excellent which made the entire process seamless.
There are a few items of note which may be worth consideration.
We could not find a hair dryer even though one is listed in the amenities. We did not mention it to the host while we were there because it was not a big deal for this stay, but you may want to consider travelling with your own just in case.
The shower is comically small. Think of something you might find in an RV. It did serve its purpose, and I guess is somewhat common in a 1920's home, but it could be an issue for larger adults.
Finally, a 9:00 am check out is pretty early. So, make sure that works with your plans. I imagine having extra time between guests helps Michael to maintain the cleanliness of his home which, in the end, is probably worth the sacrifice.
In all, this was a great experience, and I would not hesitate to recommend this property to my family or friends.
Thank you Michael!"

Not only that the bed is comfy and the place is warm as toast. Michael is an excellent communicator, and made sure everything was sparkling clean for us. Only five minutes to grocery stores and great coffee. As well we visited two excellent museums in town. Highly recommend the Ute Museum of Indigenous culture, and the Wild West Museum. Both had amazing exhibitions. We feel blessed to have been able to stay in your cottage, Michael."

- Visited Black Canyon National Park and did some great hikes
- Rented a pontoon boat on Blue Mesa Reservoir
- Viewed wildflowers and did some shopping in Crested Butte
- Played 18 holes of golf at Cobble Creek
- Walked to nearby restaurants in Montrose.
The house itself is pretty basic - as advertised, and the location was great. The size was perfect for three of us including my 11-yo. daughter. There was a nice selection of movies and games, and the back porch is pleasant for sitting and having a drink or playing cards. Check-in was easy with a smart lock, and Michael checked in with us a couple of times to make sure that we had everything we needed. Overall a good value and experience."

Located about 20 to 25 minutes from the south rim of the Black Canyon visitor center and very close to town for any groceries or restaurants. The place is beautifully decorated and also felt very homey. Very quiet location and I’m a very light sleeper. The only regret I have was not spending more time at the place!"

Stayed a few nights","Michael’s place is a real gem! The home is very clean, cozy and comfortable and is in a quiet neighborhood. The location is in the center of town, so close to everything and has a nice walking path a block away. I was most impressed with how thoughtful Michael was both as a host planning the space and for communication. The house is very well stocked with amenities, including one of the best pantries I’ve had at an Airbnb (including plenty of gluten free foods which was great). He even remembered a fire extinguisher for emergencies! The locking system is also very easy and makes going in and out a breeze. I could keep going on and on about all the pros of Michael’s place, but better yet book the space and find out for yourself. It’s a great deal!"

The outdoor area is really nice too, with a big umbrella so we loved hanging out there in the shade. The bedrooms were comfortable and it was great having ceiling fans in every room. It was close enough to walk to some shops and restaurants. We walked over to get donuts one morning. We would definitely stay there again. Thanks!"

Stayed with kids","This place is clean, has everything you need, is strategically organized and easy to find all the essentials. It is also in a central location. The back deck was functional and added an additional room so to say. The washer/dryer were very nice, little things I forgot at home and thought I’d have to buy were there, plenty of towels/blankets/pillows. The linens were nice and very clean. Felt like it had just been somewhat renovated and smelled fresh. It has a few little flaws but it ads to its charm.
Only thing that was a little off were the doors to the bedrooms, one was a folding door and offered little privacy/quiet, and the other door did not latch closed all the way which made it hard with a baby.
Still though, great place, great stay"

The listing said it was recently remodeled and we were impressed with the high quality finishes, upscale appliances and comfortable layout. Parking was spacious and we appreciated the motion-detector lights when we returned after dark. Greg was very friendly and responsive and had some great tips in his guidebook - we really liked the CO Boy Brewery and Camp Robber restaurants, San Juan Coffee House and Backstreet Bagel. The location was great - we were walking distance to downtown Montrose, a short drive from the South Rim entrance of Black Canyon National Park and only 45 minutes from the town of Ouray (we loved hiking the challenging but amazing Perimeter Trail there). We would definitely stay at Greg's place again and highly recommend it to other travelers!"

The fully stocked kitchen (with even essential cooking ingredients like oil, salt and pepper, spices, etc.) gave us the option to cook instead of eating out, which is so convenient when your travel plans may involve late evenings after many restaurants have closed. The listing was very clean, the bed was comfortable, and the neighborhood was very quiet. Location was amazing - only 20 minutes to Black Canyon of the Gunnison, an hour from hikes near Mt Sneffels, and a bit further than that to Ouray and Telluride. I would highly recommend this place!"

The wall between the two units lacks soundproofing. We could hear the other tenants walking around, sounds like they are in our unit. Also could hear muffled talking and water, etc. The other tenants did nothing out of the ordinary or loud, but we were so aware of them it made us very cautious about any sounds we made."

Stayed a few nights","Greg's duplex was the perfect hub for our Southwestern Colorado adventure! The place is located in a cute, quiet, safe neighborhood and located within walking distance of town. The unit itself was beyond our expectations. It was cute, clean, had top tier amenities, easy parking, and a new shed for our bikes. This is a remodel of an older home but it was done well...very modern but still had original wood flooring! My wife is allergic to dogs so finding a rental that doesn't bother her allergies is tough. I know 'no pets' may be a deterrent for some but that is exactly why we would rent this place again.
This was a nice place to come back to as we explored Silverton, Telluride, Ouray, Gunnison Natl Park, Glenwood Springs, Grand Mesa Natl Park and much more! Perfect location!
Greg is a great host that made us feel at home: with clear instructions on anything we needed with the home, as well as recommendations for how to enjoy Montrose."

Stayed a few nights","We had a fantastic stay at Greg's lovely, modern duplex in Montrose! It was very clean, spacious, well-designed and outfitted with high-quality fixtures and stylish lighting. Greg was an excellent host -- fast, warm, welcoming, helpful and detailed in all his communication. His attention to detail and thoughtfulness in supplying many items beyond the essentials made it one of the best-equipped Airbnbs we've stayed at. The kitchen was extremely well-stocked with a huge range of kitchenware including plenty of glasses, kitchen tools and baking tools not often found in Airbnbs, Pyrex dishes, oven trays, blender, cover for food in the microwave, cling wrap, foil, ziplock bags and a drawer of spices. The couch was very comfortable as were the stools and bed. It was really handy to have a washer/dryer in the bedroom plus parking at the rear. Last but not least, it was great the location was so close to Main Street and Riverbottom Park."

The property has a hospital right behind it, which I thought might be a bit noisy, but not at all.
Greg was easy to work with and had great communication.
Part of my stay, there were folks in the other side of the duplex. The only time I knew they were there was when the oak floors creaked, which was not at all disruptive.
All in all a great, well located place."

There are thoughtful little touches like remotes for the light, fan and AC/heat which is nice when you don't want to get out of bed to turn them off.
I met the housecleaner and she was super nice and took pride in her work. The neighborhood is very cute and an easy walk to downtown. The storage shed in back looks like a very secure place to store bikes or other outdoor toys if you're traveling with them. I'd definitely stay here again!"

There were only two negative things I can say about it. One is it is downstairs and there is a space they rent upstairs. No one was there while I was there but someone came to clean. You can hear every footstep. I don't think there is carpet upstairs. There was a little one that was running around quite a bit. I heard every step of the person cleaning. I could hear them talking at one point. I was trying to work and the noise was very distracting. Also, I think the bed has a plastic type of mattress cover. Despite keeping the temperature very cool at night, the plastic caused me to sweat which made it difficult to sleep well. While I loved everything else about it, I wouldn't want to stay there if someone was renting the space above."

Great bathroom and shower. I also love the rural setting. It is an amazing stress relief to be away from the busy atmosphere of the city or even a suburb.

Stayed one night","2 weeks later we still remember our stay as a bad experience. We arrived almost at 9pm, it was already dark. There are several houses at this address but the sign does NOT list the proper one. It lists other houses & also some Twin Pines. The AirBnB description does NOT say Twin Pines anywhere (only the last pic does - but who ever remembers a picture after they booked their stay)! We drove in nonetheless hoping to see our house but it was nowhere seen. Instead several dogs were ran at us, barking. We turned around, went up the street hoping to find our house but it wasn't there. We returned to where GMaps led us & tried calling the host. No answer, the mailbox is full - unprofessional! We drove again in, this time someone came out & said this is the right place, pointed somewhere into black night, saying the host should've left the lights on (indeed).
We wouldn't complain in other circumstance, but: there was Keurig with 1 pod only, no tea bags, empty roll of toilet paper (come on!)"

Stayed a few nights","Madison's apartment was so cute and cozy after long mornings in the mountains! The pictures are accurate, and the apartment is bright and beautiful. The property is on a farm a few miles outside of town, which was so nice to have peace and quiet. The only thing to take into account is you're on the first floor of a two floor building, and upstairs is another Airbnb property. I could hear the upstairs guests as they got home, walked up the stairs, and around the unit. Something to consider if you're sensitive to this!
Overall, I would 100% stay here again. It's a lovely location and less than an hour from the San Juans."

The house was absolutely gorgeous and well appointed. Very quiet! We only stayed a night on our road trip around Colorado but wish we stayed longer!
The best part!? Puppies! We were greeted by 3 of the friendliest 🐶 as dog parents missing our two at home it made this feel like home! We opened the blinds on the door the next morning to a happy go lucky chocolate lab waiting for some lovin’.
We could not recommend this stay enough! This was our second trip to Colorado and we absolutely love the state. When we go back we’ll be booking here again!"

So happy we found this place, very affordable and right in central Montrose. Great stay all around. Was nice and toasty inside the airstream and plenty of blankets to stay warm. Complementary coffee and their cat Mr. Fritz (don’t worry if you’re allergic - he hangs outside) made the stay all that better. Bathroom inside the house easily accessible, just a few steps from the airstream, and very clean. 10/10 would recommend."

The Airstream itself is great, well decorated with thoughtful little details that honour its heritage from the past. Everything worked perfectly and although we did not really use it since the weather was not too hot, the AC is a real plus. It is quite spacious for two, with many compartments for organising your personal belongings, a couch, a counter to prepare your meal and a table to dine inside if you want to. The backyard it is located on is also very beautiful with its string lights, a quite original teepee, and an outdoor table for those who enjoy dining under the stars.
We found the use of the shared bathroom very convenient since it is in reality quite private and very easy to access : you just have to cross the backyard and you use a private entrance. The bathroom is nice and clean, and once again very nicely-decorated.
Communication was really easy and we met with Matthew on our departure, who was very nice !"

The Airstream itself was a true gem. Lovingly restored and maintained, it showcased the perfect blend of nostalgia and modern comforts. The sleeping area was surprisingly comfortable, with the cozy bedding embracing us in a warm embrace each night.
Lastly, the hosts were outstanding. They were attentive, warm, and welcoming, making sure we had everything we needed for a fantastic stay.
I also want to highlight the outstanding hosting by Brittany, who truly went above and beyond to ensure our stay was exceptional. Throughout our stay, she was available to answer any questions we had and offered helpful tips for exploring the area."

Stayed about a week","Brittany has curated a wonderful mix of vintage airstream (Clyde) with modern amenities. The location is close to everything Montrose and many restaurants and coffeeshops are easily within walking distance. Off street parking, outdoor chill area with fire ring and picnic table, along with their adorable cat (Fritz) pushed this listing over top. Clyde is a very welcoming stay with a very comfortable bed. Be sure to read the hand written note and check in instructions, this adds to understanding the layout, although simple enough, I did not and wished I had earlier. I hope this listing is available on our next visit to the Western Slope."

Even though the bathroom was shared, it did not cause any inconvenience at all and its thoughtful positioning away from the main part of the house was appreciated.

We used it as a base point for visiting the Black Canyon and a trip to Ouray. The cottage was very clean, the bed was very comfortable and had very nice linens. The bathroom was clean and had plenty of towels. The kitchen was very well stocked, so may extras that are very rare in other rentals. We had a dozen fresh eggs and some brownies waiting for us as well, delicious. My wife and I were very pleased with everything and would recommend a stay at this cottage."

Stayed a few nights","Kim and Jerry were fabulous hosts and The Commons at Spring Creek Cottage was a fantastic spot to call our home while in SW Colorado!
Even before arriving, Kim and Jerry made us welcome with clear, friendly, and helpful communications. They went above and beyond answering questions I asked about the area.
The cottage was perfect: cozy living room space, well stocked kitchen (with homemade baked goods from the hosts), comfortable bedroom and bathroom, and an adorable patio with breathtaking views.
We loved that the cottage was situated on a quiet country road outside of Montrose, which is full of amenities. We did day trips to Telluride, Silverton/Durango, Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, and Ouray. This cottage truly is a fantastic location to do it all!
Check out was super easy and we even got to meet the hosts. They are so kind and welcoming. If we are ever back in the area, we will definitely stay with them again! Thanks for providing us a home away from home!"

Stayed with a pet","What a wonderful place with marvelous hosts, beautiful surroundings and just perfect in every way. I've stayed in many Airbnbs all over America and Europe and this is probably the nicest one ever. Montose is an excellent location to see so many great sights: Black Canyon of the Gunnison NP, Ridgway, Ouray, Telluride, Rico and many other lovely places. The street where you'll stay is like staying in the country with chickens, cows, horses and lots of interesting neighbors engaged in farming. It's like a step back in time.
I also want to mention that if you're travelling with your dog, the house is very dog friendly. Kim provides water/food bowls, doggy bedding and an ample backyard where your furry friend can sniff, explore and get some exercise. Dog walks are great on a bucolic road with little traffic. The kitchen is well stocked with anything you might need to cook or prepare your meals.
I give this Airbnb by highest recommendation, it's perfect in every way!"

Stayed a few nights","The star of this AirBnB is the hosts - we arrived to fresh baked goods, fresh cut flowers, and farm-fresh eggs. The communication was great, and the cottage has all kinds of unexpected extras - spices, cooking oils, toiletries, teas and coffees, so many extras. The cottage also has amenities you won’t find at many AirBnBs, including fiber-based internet (the WiFi was 300 Mbps downlink/uplink, incredible and perfect for work!), a dishwasher and full-sized washer and dryer.
The decor of the cottage is just like the pictures, I would call it “grandma’s farmhouse” The back porch has a great view of the mountains, but the back of the Cottage has no windows in the common areas to see this view. There are small windows in the laundry room and back bedroom, but we were disappointed we couldn’t see the view from the kitchen or living room.
Overall a great experience, and we enjoyed our time in Montrose at the Cottage."

Kim's pre-arrival communications were great. The instructions were clear and easy to use, and there was a book of useful information about the house and a basket of local information brochures. But the best part of the stay was how warm and welcoming they were. They invited us to pick produce and herbs from their garden, and left eggs from their chickens in the frig and a freshly baked treat on the table. The plums from their tree were good enough to be worth a trip back on their own! It was so peaceful to stay there that if I lived closer than half a continent away I would be a regular guest."

But I also enjoyed that she left free eggs from their chickens, offered produce from their garden and baked a sweet treat.
This property is a few miles outside of town so may not work for those wanting to walk places but virtually all visitors need a car for this area and the quiet here makes for a great stay!"

Of note, the refrigerator is a mini refrigerator, but there is also a full-size refrigerator/freezer available in the shed next door so that was perfect for all of our drinking water and freezer items. The house even had two coffee makers in it! One was a Keurig, which I loved, and the other was a drip coffee maker. Plenty of coffees, too! We very much enjoyed sitting out on the patio in the mornings and evenings watching the birds, and looking at the gorgeous snow covered mountains in the distance. The setting is very peaceful.

Situated on a dirt road out in the country, this place is an oasis of calm and beauty. The adorable 2-bedroom cottage sits on a spacious lot across from corn fields with spectacular views of the mountains. There is a small stream that runs along the back of the property whose sounds soothe the soul. Deer visited from the cornfield and the neighboring cat came for morning rubs. Sitting out on the patio was so relaxing after a busy day of exploring. The house was immaculately clean, the bed was super comfy, and the shower was hot. The location was close enough to Montrose but far enough away to make you feel like you were in a special place, all your own. I would definitely recommend the cottage a a premier place to enjoy the area!!!!"

Stayed a few nights","We had an amazing time at Jerry and Kim’s cottage. The location is incredible, being about 5 minutes outside of Downtown Montrose, it’s surrounded by farmland. It’s super quiet and serene. The front and back yard of the cottage are beautiful and I enjoyed sitting in the back drinking coffee in the morning and eating dinner in the evening and listening to the animals and running water. The cottage itself is great also. Two comfortable queen size beds, a good sized kitchen with all you would need, full sized bathroom, and a quaint living room with books and tv. Jerry and Kim were incredibly nice and communicated wonderfully. A couple weeks before our trip, they messaged us details about the ongoing road closures on the main highway into town and were very informative about getting to the cottage. Overall, I wish I could have stayed longer!!"

Stayed a few nights","Great place for a quiet stay..
Kim and Jerry made our stay very special. Communication was fast, very friendly and helpful and even had some fresh vituals for us when we arrived. The Commons is fully equipped with lots of charming details. We loved taking our meals on the patio together with the marvelous view at the mountains. The peaceful atmosphere was emphasized by the delightful hummingbirds around us or the visiting doe. The Commons is in easy travelling distance to Black Canyon NP or the hot springs near Ridgeway. Montrose provides all necessary services nearby. We can definitely recommend Kim and Jerry‘s place!"

Stayed a few nights","What a wonderful place. I opened the door and began to feel the stress of travel and needs of life just bleed away. If you need rest and quiet this is the place. We were a party of three (married couple and daughter) and never felt crowded. Rather, for a smaller house it felt very spacious. It's clean, bright, comfortable and well-decorated. On the latter, some places we've stayed are almost choked with cute stuff - the decor here is tasteful and welcoming, not at all overpowering. Attention to detail??? Who puts earplugs in the bathroom on the chance that you find yourself with someone who snores? Someone who cares, who has the gift of hospitality. My only regret about staying here is not meeting Kim and Jerry - my bad, and another reason to return! Thanks for sharing your place."

I so appreciated Kim's kindness when she put me in touch with her friend from the Audubon Society after she learned that I'm a birder. The neighborhood is idyllic. I miss those gorgeous views, strolling down the road past the neighbor's horses and enjoying the sunsets over the mountains from the back patio. Kim is available without being intrusive. She's compiled lots of helpful information about the area. My husband and I had a great time there and would stay there again in a heartbeat!!!"

We loved the farm fresh eggs and home baked sweet bread provided by the owner. Visiting the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park was well worth the trip to Montrose.

On the dining table is homemade cookies, jam and protein bars ready to be packed for the days activities. In the fridge are fresh eggs and the coffee area is well stocked for morning. The back patio invites you to press pause and enjoy the beauty surrounding you.

Kim and Jerry were wonderful hosts and were very accommodating to help us work productively, while allowing us to enjoy the beauty and peacefulness of the area. They made sure we had work spaces and plenty of power strips and USB connections for all of our devices. The internet speed was also very good and reliable.
There were tasty treats and breakfast foods provided for our first couple of mornings. The morning beverage selections include coffee, a nice assortment of teas, and hot cocoa with all the mix-ins. The kitchen was well stocked with all of the needed dishes, pots/pans, storage containers, and utensils. Although the refrigerator in the cottage is small, we had easy access to the full size refrigerator/freezer located in the small shed just outside. This was very handy and supported our longer stay needs.
Kim and Jerry were very welcoming of our dog. They provided a dog bed and dog bowls for him as well.

There was a lot of information regarding all of the different activities that are accessible in the area. This was very helpful in planning some of our weekend activities.
The outside shed was also a great place for us to safely store our road bikes. It was nice to be able to have them locked in a secure location during our stay.
The back patio with pergola was a wonderful feature. It allowed us to sit outside in the afternoon and enjoy some shade while soaking in the mountain views. The hanging lights from the pergola allowed us to enjoy the evening hours while watching the alpenglow on the mountain range.
It was a wonderful place to call home for a month!"

An older home that wears its years well, it was comfortable and cozy and made for a nice base of operations for the short time we were exploring area. An earlier reviewer mentioned the shower and we concur, it is one of the best ones I've ever encountered in an Airbnb - or any other place, for that matter. Jan was courteous and informative regarding the area and history of the house and town. As a former history teacher, this was one of my favorite elements to our stay.

The house was immaculate and we enjoyed the full kitchen, nice bathroom and the super comfy beds. Jan had everything you’ll need for a restful stay. Walking path with access to Main Street with shops and restaurants was great. Having Jan as your reliable host is a gift, he is kind, fun and full of great recommendations. We can only hope his place is available next time we are in town!"

It was hotter than normal when we checked in and we would have appreciated having the a/c running. Updated flooring in the living and bedrooms would really help. Overall we were satisfied and enjoyed our stay.

The rooms were absolutely charming, and filled with all kinds of art. Everything was comfortable, and the house had a lived-in and cozy feel. You could tell that there was a fun culture to the property, and former guests would leave all types of supplies in the kitchen and bathroom. We happened to meet Jan and had a fun encounter with him. He was super nice to us and to our guests. This was really a great visit for my wife and I. The older neighborhood is quiet, and a pleasure to stay in. Jan is a super host and takes his artful approach to hospitality very seriously. A real gem!"

Stayed a few nights","Great experience with Jan and his property. Jan was very responsive to my messages, helping me with questions or just replying to my followups.
The property was exactly what I wanted. It's a charming place, with a wonderful mix of orginal floorplan, with original doors and windows...and then with modern updates in the vital areas of bathroom and kitchen. Updates in the bathroom include a large shower, and the kitchen has an updated sink, dishwasher, fridge and stove. Other modern updates which came in handy was a printer that was available to tie into my laptop, as well as streaming TV, and a charging station with various connector types to charge devices. Jan has really put thought into making the space function for the traveller.
The back porch was large with chairs to sit out for morning coffee, and watch the hummingbirds.
My daughter and I spent five very comfortable days there, using the house as our base for the evening, as we enjoyed time with family that lives in the area. It was perfect for our needs."

Decorated with the owner’s (and perhaps family member) art etc it was very personal and comfortable. AC in front room so rest of house can get hot during day- night cools down just fine.

Group trip","We had an absolutely fantastic month-long stay at Ronnie’s Airbnb! The house itself was wonderful, and the location was ideal for our off-roading adventure. We had a blast exploring off-roading trails, hiking, and visiting Black Canyon off the Gunnison.
One of the standout features of this Airbnb is its prime location. It’s conveniently situated near grocery stores, gyms, and restaurants, making it incredibly convenient for day-to-day living.
Ronnie, our host, deserves special recognition. He truly went above and beyond to ensure our stay was as comfortable as possible. We had a few special requests, including an early check-in and check-out, and Ronnie was more than accommodating, handling everything with a pleasant and welcoming attitude.
I can’t recommend Ronnie’s Airbnb enough, and I look forward to returning for another memorable visit. Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable!"

This house is easy to find and a short drive from down town. Ronnie is very good with communication."

Stayed about a week","5 Stars! Highly recommended.
Ronnie’s place is perfectly situated in Montrose. It is a short drive in any direction to many great places to see and experience. For my group, our mission was a fly-fishing expedition. We were able to fish the East Portal of the Gunnison at Black Canyon one day, then the Delores River just under Telluride the next. North Fork? No problem! All within an easy and very scenic drive. We took hundreds of photos! Aside from the house location, the house itself was sparkling clean and dust-free. The kitchen had everything we needed for cooking our own meals. Ha! My first experience with high-altitude cooking. Finally, that subsection for high-altitude cooking directions actually applied to me! They left coffee gift cards and bowl of chocolates. A nice touch. The beds are also quite comfortable. If you’re looking for a place that’s centrally located to some of Colorado’s finest, look no further!"

This was the perfect location for all the day trips we were taking and for a much more affordable price than staying in Ouray or Telluride. The kitchen was stocked with all the essentials for cooking meals and we loved that coffee was provided so we did not have to bring our own. There were plenty of towels and linens for our group and we appreciated having the use of a washer and dryer since this was our 2nd of 3 stops along our trip. The house is in a very quiet neighborhood with minimal travel to get into town. We would absolutely stay here again!!!

Stayed with kids","I believe the information given on web was accurate. The house was plenty in size for 2 couples and 2 kids. The bathroom off the hall was adequate, but a little tight, not a lot of space for putting personal items while getting ready. Missed my ceiling fans in bedrooms and missing some space to put phone, ipad etc. on, while charging at night. Also, missed a tv in bedroom but it all worked out. Had plenty of items in kitchen so we could make breakfast and a supper. Neighborhood was quiet, an unusual view out the backyard, but no issues with it, and a far off the mountains were nice to look at. We enjoyed our 2 day stay there and with the laundry facilities it was great not to have to go to the laundromat. I guess it would have been nice if the lights on the front of house could have been on when we arrived, as it was dark and had to pull into a couple of wrong driveways until we found the correct one, but we finally did. It's a nice house and it's well kept and clean."

Our whole trip had many unforseen hiccups especially with our rental car not starting. Sue was so helpful she reached out to one of her resources for a battery jump, with the neighbor next door, on New Years Day at 8 am!!! What a relief! The house is very spacious and layout was great, letting us all stay together when eating and watching TV. Lots of towels, fully stocked kitchen, bath accessories, laundry detergent. The house supplied everything we needed and grocery stores was very close by. Despite all the obstacles we made the most of our sking trip. Highly recommend. Thank you Sue for everything!"

The cottage has so many extras such as hot chocolate packets (in addition to the typical coffee pods), ziplock bags, soap/shampoo/conditioner dispensers in the shower; Valerie thought of everything! Also, there is a binder with local restaurant & shop information.
As a bonus, we stayed during peach & vegetable harvest time (early September) so were able to get some of their delicious peaches and tomatoes! I highly recommend Valerie's cottage."

Stayed a few nights","It was like staying with family. The orchard is great and the fruit fresh and sweet. On the 4th of July Valerie invited us to join her family for a meal and fireworks. We ahd great conversations with the family and the farm workers. Lots to learn about growing peaches!
We loved our stay and will be coming back."

I highly recommend Valerie's cottage, in Olathe! Close enough to Delta or Montrose , CO, that you can stay in contry setting, and be in eithe city quickly. I wanted to move in and stay... it was really good."

Stayed a few nights",We stayed at Valerie’s place while visiting Black Canyon of the Gunnison. Valerie was very friendly and introduced herself to us as we arrived. The place was cozy and one of the cleanest Airbnbs I’ve stayed in. This was one out of the many places we stayed during our 9-day road-trip and it ranks high on the list. A peaceful place. The decorations were so cute.

Stayed a few nights","Lovely little cottage. It is so thoughtfully designed to have everything you need without feeling cluttered. It was nice waking up to sunrise over the surrounding mountains & farmland. I bought some pear juice from the host’s farm stand to bring home. Zero complaints about the amenities there.
Location: There doesn’t seem to be much going on in Olathe itself so be prepared for a little bit of a drive to reach most of the main activities in the area. Montrose is ~20 min. & has everything you could need in terms of big box stores, pharmacies, etc. Rideway is ~40 min. & cute as can be if you’re looking for small town mountain feel. Ouray is about an hour - worth the drive to check out the “Switzerland of America.” Highly recommend a visit to Orvis Hot Springs near Ridgeway."
