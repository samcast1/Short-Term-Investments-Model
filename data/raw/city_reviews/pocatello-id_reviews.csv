Stayed with a pet","During my lengthy stay of 10 weeks, I gained a deep understanding of what it's like to live here for an extended period, which might differ from the experience of staying just a few days.
Pros:
It’s a budget-friendly option for pet owners, featuring in-unit laundry, a parking garage, and negotiable terms.
Cons:
Uneven floors, misaligned doors, faulty wiring, and a moldy, leaking garage.
The shared address led to frequent delivery mix-ups due to poor signage, that need to be fixed by the owner.
As a tall(6.2) individual, the bathroom's cramped conditions, with a tiny toilet and rusted shower rod cause lots of trouble and disappointment.
Lastly, the waste disposal process was notably inconvenient, requiring a lengthy walk to transport bins across the the other side of block.
Overall, 4 start for the budgetting, and can be 5 star if you only stay short term"

Very private but also felt safe. Only thing is that there are some steep hills and my car barely made it up, but I know I would ask them for help if I needed. I recommend this place 100%!!"

Stayed with kids","Beautiful location. The bathroom was better than I expected. The wood chips helped too. There’s log stumps we sat on around the fire which was convenient. Next time I would bring one thing of wood for the fire as they requested the large wood be used for the inside fire only. They had kindling but some was wet. But we made it work, no problem! We would come again! They had fun games to play too. Thank you for some happy memories."

We had a great time playing board games together, snuggling and drinking hot cocoa during a movie, and gazing at the moon and stars through the clear dome in ths ceiling.

Stayed a few nights","the yurt was so cool! i’ve never stayed in a place like that! we did go in the winter and the only source of heat is from the wood stove and i have never used one of those before so it was a bit of a rough start but after i got it down, it was all warm and cozy from there on! i would recommend either bringing your own or the host providing a small space heater so you’re not freezing while trying to get the wood stove going but other than that, i loved it!"

Stayed one night","This stay was wonderful. They have the cutest dogs all around the property, made us feel very safe! The yurt location is unbeatable with gorgeous views, we felt so peaceful. They truly went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable. Very quick response times. They have everything you would need in the little yurt and we personally loved the board games and movies. We brought up some microwave meals and it was great. We only stayed one night but hopefully will be back again soon.
Had a little hiccup getting in as our car was not well equipped for snow, if you head up I 100% recommend bring a car that can handle snow if you’re going in the winter months. It was just about a half mile walk in and they were amazing at helping us out despite the difficulty. They brought us sleds for us stuff, extra snow gear to keep us warm, and plowed the road for us!
Great people, great location, great stay."

We wanted to have as close of an experience to camping with our little kids without actually staying in a tent. The yurt was clean and cozy and had room to play lots of games. The kids tired themselves out on the surrounding hikes and trampoline. And our hosts could not have been nicer! They have literally thought of everything! We would love to stay here again."

Plenty of water is provided via refilled bottled water provided by the hosts. local history can be found in the handy instruction booklet provided. I would recommend this place to those wanting a happy middle ground between ""roughing it"" and home comforts."

Stayed one night","This stay was absolutely so memorable. I’ve been to a lot of Airbnb’s but the best part about this was how thoughtful the hosts are on top of how desolate the location was. I felt like it was a comfortable glamping experience. We forgot to bring a cork for wine and of course they had one. Need extra blankets? Snacks? Entertainment? All of it was there. Every detail was so thought out which made the trip a lot less stressful. The view was perfect for a sunset, and I loved how cozy the yurt was at night. It made me feel really connected to nature and a wonderful place to plug out. Cami was one of the most professional hosts I’ve ever dealt with and the replies were so fast. Thanks again for letting us stay and enjoy such a sanctuary! It was so simple yet so enjoyable."

Stayed one night","This was my second time staying at Caribou Yurt and it was a wonderful experience! The first time there wasn't nearly as much snow so we were able to park right next to the yurt. This time there was FAR too much snow to drive to the yurt, so we parked at the time of the hill and walked down. Cami had a sled waiting for us so we could easily get our belongings to the yurt. We were thrilled we parked at the top of the hill when we woke up to nearly 7"" of fresh powder. The yurt was beautiful and cozy and Cami was incredibly responsive. This is such a good way to spend the night ""camping"" without a tent or sleeping bag. We absolutely loved our time there!"

The views were unforgettable as we were there during the start of all the colors changing on the trees. it's only 15 minutes from Pocatello so we were able to grab food and everything else we needed without driving super far. There is service at the yurt which enabled us to still be in communication with Cami if needed. We are definitely looking forward to making our next reservation here again

We appreciate all the info the host provided on hiking, fishing and things to do nearby. The beds were all comfortable, plenty of extra sheets, pillows, and the trampoline, movies, and games were a hit with our kids (and all of us). Plenty for us to do and we enjoyed connecting as a family and learning a new game (which we had to go purchase after our trip) on our one rainy afternoon during our visit, too. We loved cooking our meals over the campfire in the evening and the BEAUTIFUL sunsets and views. Such a peaceful, fun place to visit. We hope to return!"

Stayed one night",We never stayed in a yurt before so when I saw this listing I knew we had to book it. The directions were easy to follow and led us right to the yurt. It is tucked away on a hill side away from other homes and people which led to much needed solitude. The inside of the yurt was very clean and inviting. Many reviewing this destination have already commented on the comfort of the bed which I’m happy to report that I agree whole heartedly. Being the middle of July the temp outside was 100 degrees. Luckily there was a window AC unit in the yurt to cool things down. My wife and I made foil dinners on the fire and ate them in the shade at the nearby picnic table. The highlight of the evening was star gazing in the evening. We brought our pillows and small blanket from home and laid on the nearby trampoline and watched shooting stars till almost midnight. Overall it was highly enjoyable and clean and I would enthusiastically recommend staying at this truly unique yurt! Thanks for a great stay!

We love that they came and introduced themselves - it didn’t feel like staying at a hotel, but rather at a friends guest house. We felt very safe and taken care of, which was even more important to us being that we were traveling with our toddler. Cannot recommend their yurt enough!!!"

Stayed with kids","When we first made the reservation to stay at Cami and Lance's yurt, we didn't know what to expect (Was it going to be like camping? Did it have room for all of us? Would the outhouse smell?) but we were cautiously excited about the opportunity. (My wife Kathy is naturally cautious about trying new things so she was definitely more anxious than me!) We arrived around sunset and were greeted by the cutest little round building, with a trampoline out front, stacks of wood, and the prettiest view of the nearby mountain ranges and the city of Pocatello in the valley below. It immediately put us at ease (and the kids spent the next hour playing on the trampoline instead of helping out with unloading the car!) :)
The outhouse was a composting toilet - very clean, and a couple handfuls of sawdust on your ""business"" kept it smelling fresh. As for the wood-burning stove, it took us a little bit of time to learn how to use it, but once we did, it was very easy to maintain and keep the temperature straight. We slept very comfortably - they have a large, queen bed; a sofa sleeper; a lie-flat recliner; and plenty of floor space for sleeping bags/pallets/etc. Not to mention two very LARGE stuffed animals that were bigger than one of our kids!!
Kathy and the boys loved the various choices of cocoa, and once we got the kettle going on the stove, many cups were had by all. Their kitchen area has a microwave and a mini fridge, as well as all plates, utensils, napkins, etc. Any additional cooking items (pots, pans, etc) are not provided so you will need to bring your own, but Cami volunteered her Dutch oven to us and it was greatly appreciated! Also, there is a firepit outside if you want to do s'mores under the stars.
And, speaking of the stars... WOW! On a clear night, it is an absolute tapestry of God's majesty - you can see it clearly through the circular dome of the yurt's roof, but to get the full picture, you simply have to go outside. We got clear views of several planets, as well as the Milky Way, right outside our yurt. During the day, Lance let us know about a hiking trail that would take us to the top of one of the large hills in the area that used to be a ski resort run at one time. The view from the top is breathtaking - we would strongly recommend that hike to anyone!
Finally, the kids spent so much time on the trampoline that they were literally sore for the next few days. :) We would jump at the chance (see what I did there?) to stay here again. Thanks so much for opening your yurt to us, Cami and Lance! It was the experience of a lifetime."

Stayed with kids","We had a great time at the Yurt during our trip from Yellowstone to SLC. I was a little worried about the lack of air conditioning and limited water supplies in the midst of hot summer weather with two young children when I initially made the reservation. I was pleasantly surprised how much thoughts Cami and Lance put in the Yurt to overcome the challenges that come with trying to live in an isolated Yurt away from our normal industrial life. From bottled water to newspapers/matches to sawdust for the toilet, there is a solution in place for every concern I had before checking in. And don't worry, you still have electricity and cell signals. If you are visiting in a hot summer day with temp above 80F, I would recommend checking in a little late because it will be hot inside the Yurt no matter what you do but it cools down really quickly when the sun is no longer shining directly down through the ceiling. Overall, I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting or passing by Pocatello."

The hosts did a great job of making sure we were well accommodated, they were detailed and even went above and beyond and put a lot of effort into their book detailing history of yurts, their sustainable practices, firewood, etc. All in all we loved every minute and can’t wait for our next trip to Pocatello and The Caribou Yurt."

Stayed a few nights","Everything about this yurt is as described. The wood stove keeps you plenty warm. Just open the window if you get too hot to find the right temperature. I would recommend bringing some earplugs if you are a light sleeper. Idaho trends to be windy and the canvas creeks/squeaks against the wood. Not a big deal, but I was glad I always have earplugs. I'd never stayed in a yurt before, but is was a fun and unique experience."

Stayed a few nights","Perfect experience for glamping! Love the wood burning stove and the instructions were easy to follow. During the winter you will feel warm (maybe even too warm) with the fire and the blankets provided. Cami and Lance were very responsive and helpful.
You might find some small boxelder bugs from the firewood but they are harmless and easy to get rid of. They have a lot of the essentials in the yurt such as paper towels, tissues, toilet paper, foil, paper products/utensils, water kettle, ect.
You might also meet some of Camy and Lance's friendly dogs they have if you're lucky! Also a neighbor's dog might come and visit in the morning too! Lots of fun surprises and overall a must try experience! I would love to visit there again!"

The owners are great and have a sense of humor too: the studio is decorated with funny Idaho posters, Potato Heads, and fridge magnets. They even left me an Idaho Spud candy bar.
This truly is a home away from home and the neighborhood is lovely to walk at all hours."

It was very neat, clean and comfortable with lots of extra decorative touches that were appreciated. It is now a must stay any time we are passing though.
Thank you !"

We let her know that we would be arriving late (after 10pm) and asked if we could have a car left at their home. Jenny was super accommodating and very responsive to questions. Would absolutely stay again."

Stayed with a pet","This was the perfect spot for what was needed for this trip! Quick up and back to visit my daughter (who was homesick) at ISU! I was able to bring her dog too which was a HUGE bonus both for me (not having to drive solo) and for Hannah (getting to see her best friend). The room had everything I needed for an overnight stay…a comfy bed, a bathroom and access to stream a movie for girls night with my kiddo. We grabbed a sandwich at Chubby-Z’s, a cookie from Crumbl and cuddled up in bed. I loved that I had everything I needed! I forgot doggy bags and asked Hannah for grocery sacks but one of the first things I found were doggy bags! I was super thirsty having forgotten my water bottle at home and was excited to find a cold bottle of water in the fridge! Jenny didn’t miss a thing!!! This is added to my favorites for a future visit indeed."

Also walking distance to ISU which made it nice to take the dogs for walks and runs. Small room but perfectly comfortable even with my friend and both of our dogs staying as well. Kitchen is very cute and Jenny thought of everything for the bathroom. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a great place to stay in Pocatello.

The bed was super comfortable, there were plenty of toiletries and towels, extra pillows, and thankfully a oscillating fan, because the room does tend to get a little warm.

Stayed with a pet","Stayed with Jenny for a night as I was passing through. The studio is as pictured. It’s a little smaller than expected but it is spacious for one person, maybe two. I had two dogs with me and we seemed quite fine. The neighborhood is quiet. Idaho state university is nearby so it was cool to walk through that campus, which is beautiful. The bed was squeaky but comfortable for one night. As for noise, it was quiet overall. I could hear the kiddos upstairs in the morning but it didn’t bother me.
If I had to add a critique it would be that the basement was hot. It was really hot that day so that could have contributed to it. I didn’t find the fan until right before I was checking out. That’s totally my fault, but if I would have found it, I would’ve slept a lot better. I would stay here again"

A fridge, microwave, stove and oven with all the dishes you would need.
Didn't get to use the outdoor area, it was a really short trip but it looked inviting. It was quiet. Good location, but there was road construction and detours. FYI: there is a fold out couch for another person to sleep on, I had my son with me and he is about 5'11"" and he did not fit on the couch but he didn't want to sleep with mom so he made it work. James was very friendly and it was perfect for our needs."

He even offered to knock on the door when he got back to make sure everything was okay. All in all it was a good stay. I as the consumer need to pay more attention to the listings."

Stayed one night","Really appreciated the spaciousness. It's essentially a little downstairs apartment and has excellent natural lighting as well as good lights. Your hosts are just a half staircase up behind a door and responded very quickly to my questions and needs. Great bed. Everything one would need to be comfortable for a longer stay. Especially appreciated the organic Keurig coffee, and a nice herbal tea selection.
Caution: the modem is behind the bed on the bathroom side and one of the wifi options is 5G, in case you are emf sensitive or have concerns about 5G. I chose the non-5G option for wifi.
The place felt good, in spite of emf concerns."

The yard was so pretty, especially at night. The home was beautifully decorated, cozy, warm, and very clean. It had everything we could have possibly needed for our stay, including some very thoughtful treats and special touches. It felt more like a home, than a rental. We hope to return very soon.

It is a downstair apartment, so you can hear some noise upstairs, but nothing unreasonable. The kitchen had the basic amenities to cook; theres some spices, pans, dishes & utensils. Overall, we enjoyed this place."

Plenty of kitchen and bathroom supplies, comfortable bed with lots of extra linens. It was nice to see extras I don't always find like a full size washer and dryer (came in very handy after 2 weeks of traveling!), full size fridge and stove, snacks, bottled water....plus even a couple beer if I had been so inclined! James was very easy to communicate with, quick to respond plus I appreciated being able to park in the driveway. I would definitely stay again when visiting my family in Canada. Thank you!"

Using an USB-C to HDMI cord, we were able to connect our Android phones to the TV and watch from our streaming apps. The neighborhood was quiet and we loved having hiking trails into the mountains just down the street. Thank you for a wonderful place to stay Chellee!

Chellee’s art is excellent, and added a lot of local character to the place. Beds were very comfortable. The kitchen is fully updated and the shower is excellent. Everything was very clean. There also were a lot of hooks around, which I found really practical and useful for coats, towels, etc. High-quality towels and sheets. Good local restaurant recommendations through the app. Chellee was very responsive to all of my questions. Really the only thing I would change is that I could hear the downstairs neighbors through the floor and it made it hard to fall asleep. ￼"

Stayed a few nights","Chellee’s place was very close to where we needed to be and convenient for our trip. House was super cute and had everything we needed. Beds were comfortable, bathroom was spacious and the shower was awesome. Everything was in good working order. Clean and well-appointed.
Minor issue of the folk’s voices in the basement unit being heard quite loudly through the vents. We turned up the TV so we didn’t eavesdrop on them too much.
Overall an excellent stay and would definitely stay again if we are up that way."

Stayed a few nights","Chellee’s cottage is in a nice quiet neighborhood. It is clean and nicely decorated with her own art work. Her instructions were well posted and easy to follow.
As I am in a wheelchair I had concerns about getting into the home. As it turned out getting in was fine; there are three steps with a very solid railing. My problem was on the inside. Chellee had told me that the door ways were narrow due to the house’s age. As my chair is 24 inches wide I dismissed the warning and rented the house anyway. I should have listened. My chair did not fit through the inner doors. I did fine using a walker in the bedroom and bathroom. That said, the house was comfortable and quiet."

Having to take care of our parent's estate and personal belongings it was nice to come home to a comfortable, clean home. A couple nights we just sat around the table and talked about mom and dad. Your artwork was absolutely gorgeous and much appreciated since we were raised on a cattle ranch. Our family grew up in the Pocatello/Aberdeen area and it was nice to be close to downtown. We all were very comfortable and sleep well and had everything that we needed throughout the day. The area was quiet at night and the neighbors were very friendly. Thank you for sharing your home."

We only stayed 1 night but would have been perfectly fine staying for an extended time. As a matter of fact, my wife and I talked about how we wished we were staying at Chellee's place multiple nights instead of the very sterile place we stayed in Salt Lake for the rest of our trip. I would definitely stay here again!
Also, Chellee was very responsive in helping me get checked in after I had unsuccessfully attempted to check in to her other unit that is attached. This was totally my mistake and NOTHING to blame on Chellee's part whatsoever. I simply was not paying attention! She called me within 2 minutes to redirect me to the correct unit! Thanks Chellee!!"

Stayed a few nights","Great little house in a very convenient location. It is close to Old Town Pocatello - we walked over a couple times along the city walking path by the creek and river. Easy access to all parts of the city.
Quiet neighborhood, easy on street parking, super clean and well updated.
Small and cozy older house so not a ton of storage but we had plenty of room for our family during our stay."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I stayed at Chellee's place for three nights. It was cozy and comfortable, and we loved the quirky, artsy decor + design. The location was awesome: we went hiking just five minutes away on a huge trail system, were able to walk to the grocery story in 15 minutes, and a cool local brewpub is walkable, as well. The neighborhood is quiet and modest, with several little parks nearby. The very modest outside of the house is a bit misleading, as the space inside, while small, is really funky and was totally functional for all our needs. I'm not sure I would call the little electric heater an ""indoor fireplace,"" it is more of a decorative space heater - but it does do a good job warming the place up. I couldn't believe how well-stocked the kitchen was for a small place! We found everything that we needed to cook for ourselves. A little bit of noise from the folks downstairs, but nothing that created problems for us. Beds are super comfy. We were able to access our Apple TV account on the TV and watch some streaming shows. Overall, we really enjoyed staying here, and would definitely recommend to other couples, or small families with one or two kids."

The location is a short drive to town in a quiet, safe neighborhood next to a church.
What impressed me most was that everything in the home had a thoughtful touch, it truly had all the little things one could want—coffee, hair dryer, ice cubes, etc.
It is a beautiful and comfortable home with very clear directions written throughout the household.
Also, the bathroom is gorgeous with a walk-in shower."

The shower water is very hot so even if you shower in the evening it is a very nice temp. Chellee answered in a timely matter when I needed more soap and TP for the bathroom and had it delivered very quickly. Definitely will keep this place in mind for the future.

I enjoyed a outside shower in the morning and the hot water lasted longer than my shower! Easy check in, and great communication from owner. We arrived late and left early...never saw anyone.

Kitchen setup is so thoughtfully done, and I loved shopping for magnets on the mini fridge. Gorgeous views of the hills, and wonderful looking at the stars while I showered at night! No bug concerns at all - a single moth was all I saw the whole evening and morning in the bath area. The host even brought me some fresh cantaloupe in the morning. Highly recommended!"

As other reviews have likely said, the bed is sooooo comfortable BUT the vibe was our favorite part. The tiny house is right on Chellee’s property but there’s far more privacy than you might expect. Showering outside is no big deal and in fact, one of the cool parts of this place as well! If you’re even considering staying here, I say go for it. You won’t regret it! We are 100% staying here again when we come back west in the future!"

- the ceiling you’ll have to crouch a little if your greater than 6’2” (I am 6’2” so I was okay but don’t come here if your tall unless your okay with crouching while inside.

The outdoor bathroom was a little hard to adjust to, mostly because it’s cooling down at night, but I minded more than my easygoing husband.

Stayed one night","I am so glad i chose to stay here for the night. Such a cute and cozy space. The bed was huge and oh so comfy. Theres a small treehouse outside that you can sit in and below it is the rabbit's pen. Theres a very cute fluffy fellow that plays out there during the day. When you're parking, do your best to back into the spot! It's not all that difficult and makes life much easier. My favorite part of the stay was absolutely the outdoor shower. Yes outdoor. I had a night shower and it was amaaaaaazing to look up, see the stars, and listen to all the night time sounds. And the water was wonderfully hot. It does get chilly after of course but they provide robes if you need them. I would 100% stay here again just for that shower. Thank you so much for this beautiful space!"

Stayed one night","I spent one night at the bunkhouse on my way from Oregon to Colorado. Stayed in four Airbnbs and this was the most relaxing and peaceful setting of all. It’s a funky, folky property with beautiful views, lovely breezes, and a fabulous view private outdoor bathroom. Chellee left some peaches from her orchard in my room. Very thoughtful."

We enjoyed the outdoor area with comfy chairs and nice peaceful views. The outdoor bathroom and shower was such a fun experience! I loved the craftsmanship and creative details put into the whole area. Chellee was very hospitable and gave us great local tips. We are so glad we found this gem to stop for the night while driving from Alaska to Nevada!"

Stayed one night","Chellee went above and beyond as a host for us. This was our first time passing through Pocatello, and this quaint little bunkhouse was just what we were hoping for and more. Every piece of the bunkhouse was well thought out, beautiful, and exceptionally clean. It was a magical space that Chellee has created, and we’ll be back soon! Also, Chellee and her family are extremely accommodating and gave us all of the best local recommendations around Pocatello."

Stayed a few nights",Chellee was super easy to communicate with and extremely accommodating. The place is awesome and it's a great value. We enjoyed catching up on emails out on the patio and playing basketball. The place is <10 min to downtown Pocatello and Idaho State. There is also a hiking trail close by. The outdoor shower is super fun and I'd recommend this place to anyone.

We had fun using the outdoor bathroom and shower, and the water was nice and hot! Our little pup was allowed to stay with us too and she felt at home right away. The decorations were very nice and unique, with her own artwork placed around to add a nice personalized touch. We will definitely be staying there again!"

Stayed one night","Love this place! Probably my favorite Airbnb experience and I feel like we got really lucky to book it last-minute on a weekend because Chellee had literally just listed it. Super cool property and super cool space that Chellee built herself. Loved all the thoughtful touches, like the bowl of cherries and ceramic cream pitcher in the fridge, plus the host’s artwork on the wall and fridge. You can definitely tell the space was designed and decorated by an artist - so well thought out and stylish. The outdoor shower was heaven - there’s something so magical about standing under steaming hot water with the open sky and trees above you, especially on a cool, rainy day like the morning we were there. Chellee was super friendly and welcoming. Easy to book and check in and out. Also, think it’s really cool that there’s space to bring your older kids and pets, as well. I would say that, if you are over six feet tall, this might not be the best place to stay, as the ceilings are not very high. It was great for my partner and I, who are not that tall, but got to feel a bit taller than we are! Otherwise, the space is extremely spacious with a king-size bed and has everything you could possibly need. Definitely recommend!"
