Stayed about a week","I spent a week at the Bear’s Den and this will be my “Go To Place” when I return to Greeneville. The accommodations were spotless, private, roomy, and extremely comfortable, as well as being stocked with everything I needed. Toni and Joseph are exceptional hosts and readily available to answer any questions. Anyone visiting Greeneville should not hesitate to reserve the Bear’s Den.
As for restaurants, I recommend Mrs. Belt’s Cafe for breakfast or lunch, Pal’s Sudden Service for burgers, and La Perla for Mexican food. Except for breakfast I used takeout and returned to the comfort of the Bear’s Den to enjoy my meals."

She allowed us to add a guest last minute and then even refunded us the extra fee when that person decided not to join us. We would recommend to anyone looking for a nice quiet place to stay! We would 100% book with them again in the future!

The bed was comfortable and it was quiet. We enjoyed coffee on the patio in the morning listening to the rooster crow. Toni & Joe were so friendly and we’ll definitely be back! Oh and we cannot forget about the adorable dogs too! Lastly, thank you for having comfortable furniture inside and out. As a plus size woman I’m not always comfortable in new places so it was a nice change of pace. Thanks for being a great host!"

Stayed one night","We loved the stay here. The only downside would've been the fact that it is an attachment to the house. So we were downstairs. They were very understanding that we were checking in LATE. (12AM) I can say, they were extremely friendly and courteous about this. Only downfall to that, is that they want you to meet them. When you get there. And they tell you the key code and they kind of show you the place. It was inconvenient for us because we showed up so late. I felt bad. I'd rather a key code in a message, and us find our own way around. They had stairs that go up to their part of the house. Its a doorway...that enters the space where we were. And there were 3 locked doors in the air bnb space. Wasn't sure what was behind the locked doors lol but all in all, the place is very beautifully decorated. Clean. Smelt nice. They have electric fireplaces for the heat. They even have a complimentary coffee bar. We loved it. Other than the little things I mentioned."

Stayed a few nights","My daughter plays travel softball and we stay at A LOT of places, and this by far was the best we've ever been too! The apartment is decorated to the nines! So Clean and Toni has water and coffee at the ready. They have the sweetest puppies and they were a joy to talk too. If you are in the area and chose any hotel over Toni's place you will regret it. The kitchen is ready to cook anything you want and she even provides shampoo, conditioner, and body wash which by the way was not some cheapie stuff you get at hotels. The personal touch that Toni has placed on this apartment is bar none the most beautiful place I have been. It is secluded with the city being 5 minutes away. The only downfall is that we didn't get to keep the puppies! 😉 5 stars is just not enough for Toni's place, and those New York accents! 😍 Definitely would stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","What a cute place. The motif carried through out the place. Smartly decorated; comfortable and inviting. Comfortable bed and sofa, nice hot water and pressure for the shower and super quiet. Electric fireplace in the living room and bedroom was a great touch for the cool evenings (from out of state where it's dry and hot so this was quite a climate change). We didn't get to spend much time there aside from sleeping or dropping things off between running between the hospital and family's house. The time we did get to spend here provided a quite place to decompress. Would highly recommend a trip to this gem hidden in the country but close to city amenities."

It is the basement apartment of the home so you can slightly hear the family ans their four legged friend upstairs but this was not an issue for us at all and it wasnt enough to bother us in anyway. I woukd highly suggest this for anyones future stay and I also plan to stay here again. Thanks!"

The pictures don't do this place justice. It's a large area and it has everything you'd need for a short or long stay. I give the whole experience a 5 star because it really is. I'd be shocked if anyone gave it less.
I've stayed at many airbnb's all over the country and most aren't exactly as advertised. This one is. And it stands out.
I Came in for a concert at Niswonger and it's just right down the street. You can get to just about anything Greeneville TN has to offer in a few minutes. You won't be disappointed."

Group trip","I came here for a friends’ wedding and chose Janet’s home because of the horses. As an animal lover I was biased to that alone, haha.
Janet is a super friendly host and had a lovely home. She left us treats to give her horses which made the experience so much fun! Her dog was also super cute and greeted us.
The beds were comfortable, the space was clean, and the home was set on a beautiful farm. There were snacks and a coffee station in the living room and tv available to watch. Wi-Fi was also strong.
10/10 I would definitely stay here again"

All the other bnbs in the area only have queen beds so it was nice to have a king! I was a little grossed out by the amount of silverfish everywhere but other than that it was a nice stay!

Our son’s wedding was at The Homeplace at Johnston Farms, and this was literally 4 minutes away. It made it so convenient to go back for things you forgot, or only have a 4 minute drive at the end of a long day/evening to rest.
Janet was a great and gracious host. Large bedrooms & bathroom. We had my handicapped parents with us, and there was no access problems to anywhere.
Hope to return again to have more time to relax & enjoy the horses. Definitely recommend!"

I was a bit confused when we arrived as it is actually a duplex and we were in #1. Also the lock on the door was confusing when you touched it only 2 numbers appeared but then the entire key pad lit up.
There were 2 remotes for the living room tv and I could not ever find detailed instructions (as I am not very tech savvy) and had to call my husband.
The beds were comfortable. In the downstairs bath there is a square thing directly as you enter on the left and did not have a clue what that was? Bath seemed to drain a bit slow but worked fine with nice pressure.
I would definitely recommend and will stay again if available when we need it."

I would definitely be back depending on the circumstances. I booked it for 5 adults and one infant so my family could stay together for our vacation. But once I read the house rules left inside the home (not on the listing) it stated we could only use 2 parking spots. My family was coming from 3 different locations. Therefore my son’s family with my granddaughter could not stay with us. Which was disappointing being that is the reason we came to Greeneville. I would highly recommend if you only have 2 cars to park. This is my 3rd airbnb/Vrbo I’ve stayed at in Greeneville and by far the best.

I found a very clean place that provided everything myself, or any guest for that matter, would ever need during my stay. There are several good options for dining in the area. This is a charming cottage with great care that was given to functionality and comfort as well as nice details related to the local history of Greeneville, TN. I felt welcomed upon my arrival with the lights turned on and snacks to enjoy after a long day of travel. I also felt very safe during my stay and slept like a baby in a very comfortable bed .

Stayed a few nights","Cathie was an excellent host! The home was available for an early check in and she emailed me to let me know. Very responsive above hostess. The home itself is old and feels like my grandparents home when I was young. We originally had an old door code emailed to me to check in and after multiple attempts, I checked the app and saw there was a different code. The ceiling is very low and every room had a different floor level. The room I stayed in had a fairly noticeable slope to it and if I didn’t brace my suitcase, it would roll across the room. If you are 6’ or taller, you will have a hard time fitting inside the shower as the ceiling in the shower is the lowest of all the ceiling heights due to the elevated level the tub is built on. All said, it served us fairly well to sleep, shower and head out for the day. As much as I enjoyed communicating with Cathie, we won’t stay here again."

I sat outside in the mornings, listening to nature, watching hummingbirds come to the feeder and flutter around the porch area. Total tranquility offering an escape from the typically hectic place of life. A very Walton family atmosphere, minus the chores.
The house was very comfortable for three of us. It was well equipped for a normal family environment. Should I return to the area in the future, I'll certainly check the availability first thing. John Denver could've been singing about this place in his classic hit song, ""Country Roads"". It really is almost heaven."

We had everything we needed especially in the kitchen. The gas fireplace made the house even cozier.
This is an old farmhouse and the floors are a little uneven and the ceilings are low. It was not a problem for us though.

Cathie checked in while I was there to make sure I had everything I needed. The little farmhouse is more than I expected and just the place to relax and unwind. Everything you need is there and you’ll quickly feel at home. There’s a huge refrigerator, all the kitchen essentials and pantry with coffee and other staple goods, as well as a big bathroom with very good water pressure. The bedrooms are comfortable and just right for a good night’s sleep. Sitting on the porch and watching the sun rise or set over the pastures with mountain views is the best way to start or end a peaceful day. You’ll probably see cows and horses grazing too. It’s less than 10 miles to town where you will find grocery stores and other stores to meet any needs you may have. I will definitely come back to the farmhouse on future visits. I highly recommend the little farmhouse!"

We enjoyed walks and drives along the winding rural roadways. The sights and sounds of cows, sheep, ducks and horses were charming. The farmhouse had all the utensils we needed for cooking, a spacious refrigerator and freezer, spices and handy extras in the cupboard. The home was decorated and furnished just perfectly. It was a cozy country experience and the hosts were super friendly, as advertised!"

Buffalo Trail Orchard is very near where you can pick apples, pumpkins and go on a hayride. The car museum was really interesting. Enjoyed the historical sites of Andrew Johnson. Short drive to Davy Crockett’s birthplace. Cathie shared with us about visiting The Meadow Creek Fire Tower....it’s a must do! Cathie also shared eating at The Gathering Place Cafe...dinner was a good home-cooked meal. We also cooked at the farmhouse. It had all the things we needed. Beds were real comfy. Easy check-in and out! Definitely want to rebook this place!"

However, it has everything you would need to prepare a meal and plenty of dishes and utensils. The location was perfect for us traveling in Greenville and to knoxville.

Cathie is an endearing hostess who has thought of her guests’ every need and is quickly available should you need her. It goes without saying that her home is spotless, that the beds are comfortable, and the towels are soft. What else could one expect from such a place? I think that my very favorite thing about Cathie’s home was the delicate music of the wind chimes that serenaded us just outside our window. I fell asleep to their sweet lullaby."

We came here to have a little relaxing time with our daughter and 3 grands. We were joined the last night by the son in law.
The cabin was great. Rebuilt from the 1800's I believe. Just enough room for all of us.
The frontroom, kitchen, dining area, were large enough for us to sit around comfortably. The front deck was nice with rockers and another chair. The view from here was amazing.
The downstairs bedroom was a good size. The bed was very comfortable. There was a dresser and plenty of room. The bathroom was large with a walkin shower.
Upstairs is a loft with a nice size bed and 1/2 bath. The rails had a protective barrier around the lower portion.
There is a stocked pond out front giving a beautiful view. We caught a lot of bass and blue gill. This is a good place to fish with kids because the fish bite often."

Stayed with a pet",Beautiful and comforting cabin on a beautiful fam. Easy to find and well worth the price! The place has obviously been lovingly restored and the farm is well kept! I plan to make a return trip for the joy of traveling. The host was accommodating and demonstrated empathy during our travels and made a difficult time easier for us. Thank you Erin.

There were books, games and movies for the evening also. We had all the amenities we needed. We enjoyed coffee on the porch in the morning. This cottage was a great stop for us to rest and relax.
Erin was a great host who responded to our questions quickly and was always very friendly. We will recommend to our friends."

Stayed a few nights","I was in the area for a history event, so spent most of my daylight time off the property. While there, though, the cabin was comfortable and quiet. The main bed was firm, but fine for my preferences. The AC worked well. The sounds of farm life were relaxing. The large shower was unusual but great. Considering the level of privacy and comfort and the sense of security, the cabin's farm setting beats a comparably priced hotel any day! I will say that the wifi/tv was a bit spotty, but not so much that I went into tech-withdrawal. I would definitely stay here again."

Stayed one night","The last question on the review of this stay is: was Erin's place worth what you paid?
Yes, most definitely yes. Some properties have lost their senses when estimating fees, some even charge more for cleaning than the nights stay. how does one figure that?
Erin's rates is what AirBnB was once upon a time. Finding this gem is what has kept and will continue to keep us coming back to Airbnb because we've been close to disregarding the overall value and going back to a regular night's stay in a hotel.
Erin, Airbnb is in your debt for maintaining the original ideal of AirBnB."

My husband & I absolutely loved our stay here at the cabin, just beautiful. And although it’s been said that there’s no place like home. The gathering place you journey to plays a tremendous role in your inward attitude and gratitude. And if you’re anything like us, faith-family & friends is an important component in our travels. And that’s exactly how we felt as we vacationed here and as we walked out the door. This is a must stay if you’re seeking peace, coziness and friendly hospitality."

Stayed with kids","Passing through the Greeneville area on a road trip from Florida to Chicago with my mother and 2 children (ages 13 & 9) & could not be happier about our stay! The Cabin was clean and absolutely adorable. My children LOVED climbing up to a loft to sleep, my daughter said she felt just like it was Little House on the Prairie, lol. There were plenty of amenities, towels, soap, books, movies, etc. The bed on the ground floor room (where I slept) was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. Only issue was the WiFi connectivity, which Erin did warn us was spotty at best. We never could get it to work, but although my kids minded, I did not. Cell service was pretty decent, so I just used my hotspot for the kids to connect at bedtime. Very peaceful and quiet. Her description when booking was spot on and our stay exceeded our expectations. It was more than a cabin to stay in, it was an experience. We cannot wait to rebook and enjoy more of East Tennessee in the future!"

Stayed one night","Because we were traveling in February, we especially looked at the reviews from December and January to be sure that the rustic cabin stayed warm. All previous reviews were 5 stars so we were shocked to discover that there was not sufficient heat and that there was no hot water. It was in the 20's out and about 50 inside. The wall units were set to 80's but never succeeded in bringing the temp up. We ate the dinner we brought wearing coats and then climbed into bed with as many blankets as we could find. We wore double layers of clothes to bed and never undressed. We left the hot water running for ten minutes to see if we could get it to heat but it was still ice cold. We couldn't wash our dishes or bathe. We left at 6AM. The cabin is adorable but should not be offered during the winter months unless these issues are addressed."

Check-in was super easy, communication with host was excellent, and the space was fantastic. We loved doing yoga on the front porch watching the sun go down and again in the morning. Nice bird watching. Having the cows roam around was nice too. I would stay here again in a heartbeat- and would stay longer than one night next time.

The cabin is very clean and well stocked and the hosts, Ken & Gail were so kind and helpful - they definitely have the gift of hospitality - and yet - they respect our time here - so glad we had the opportunity to meet them! We will miss Ollie's big welcoming wags! If back in this area - this would be the place we would want to stay again! Thank you Ken & Gail for all you do to make this a special place - and for sharing it with us!"

The cabin is comfortable and well suited for handling day activities and providing a relaxing place for the evenings. Local town all have good food at reasonable prices. Hosts were very friendly and most helpful in finding the trail and getting our cars to the parking spots and us to the starting spots. It is a fine quiet place to relax and unwind.

Gail and Ken are fantastic hosts!
Although they have just begun their endeavor as hosts on this platform, one would not realize it based on the accommodation itself. The cabin definitely has a special warmth and charm to it and one can easily sense the tremendous devotion and creative passion that was granted it.

Stayed with kids","Beautiful home! Very clean and newly updated. We were thrilled to find it fully stocked with coffee, creamer, and sugar our first morning there after family obligations had kept us from doing our grocery shopping on arrival day.
It’s got a cute country vibe with lots of space between the houses, but is very close to grocery stores and restaurants. We did not end up using grocery delivery, but did notice that it was within range for that if desired.
Our stay was for a family wedding we attended at The Millstone and it was an easy 15 minute drive to the venue. We enjoyed sitting in the rocking chairs on the front porch catching up with family we don’t get to see as often as we like.
All of our needs were anticipated prior to arrival, and the few times we did reach out with questions or requests Danielle was communicative and accommodating.
Overall we had a wonderful stay and if we ever find ourselves in the area we would definitely consider staying here again."

Stayed a few nights","5-stars! The pictures don’t do it justice. The house and land it sits on is very secluded, peaceful, and stunningly beautiful. The place was very clean and the beds were extremely comfortable. I’ve honestly never seen a hot tub as clean as this one! The lawn was mowed and trimmed all the way down to the river. You really can’t beat the price for what you get here. I can’t wait to come back :)"

Stayed with kids","The cabin is amazing. The hot tub, grill, lights all make it a unique experience! There was some problems with our check in and the dryer not working. The host/owner did everything possible to correct the mistakes and make our experience better. I would recommend this stay to anyone looking for a relaxing, well managed, and fun Airbnb!"

Stayed one night",Excellent communication with guests and one of the cleanest places we have stayed. very comfortable and spacious. The river in the front is easily traversed in kayak and the fish are waiting for your cast. My evenings ended in the hot tub and by the fire in the quiet of the cliff in the back while dinner cooked on the grill. Truly a place to disengage and relax. I will be back.

Stayed one night","Nice peaceful place , house was clean and spacious , only thing I would say is make sure you get wifi password before going to house, might not have signal, everything was really nice there and private , loved the options of the grill, campfire with wood provided, and jacuzzi right beside the river. Would stay again"

Stayed a few nights","Andrew and Maureen are the perfect hosts! They went above and beyond in accommodating our stay for a national beach volleyball tournament held in Greeneville. They even showed up to cheer our daughter’s team on!
The nicest people and if we could give more than 5 starts, we would!
Thank you Andrew and Maureen!!!"

Stayed about a week","Very cute home with a nicely stocked kitchen, comfortable living room area and a wonderful upstairs playroom with games for all ages. We loved downtown Greenville although we spent most of our visit with our kids about 15 minutes away. Andrew was responsive to questions we had and was always friendly and helpful. Very convenient location and easy access. It is on a busy street during day but quiet in evening. We also enjoyed some of the books that were available. Thank you both."

Stayed a few nights","We were honored to be ￼ Andrew and Maureen’s first guests. We found the property very comfortable and very walkable to the historic district and a wonderful coffee shop on Main Street called the Catalyst for our morning cup of breve￼. ￼ We love the Greenville historic district! ￼ The house was extremely clean and comfortable, and everything you would need is provided. ￼ The hosts are extremely kindhearted, and even worked with us when we had a situation to work out. ￼ We would gladly return!"
