I loved that Vanessa had very detailed instructions and was very quick to respond if you had any questions. I checked out her recommendation for example for restaurants and she was spot on. I’d definitely go back and I recommend you check this house out. It’s so beautiful and clean, you will not be disappointed. Oh and Vanessa pays attention to details, so you’ll probably find all you need at the house for a comfortable stay."

Vanessa was super communicative and available as needed - she’s a wonderful individual and I was happy to meet her in person one of the days she was checking on another room! She provided lots of great insight about the area/recommendations for me restaurant/vegan food wise, etc. I needed a space to regroup and rest prior to and post a performance and found this spot to be just perfect both for that, and generally! 10/10! Stay here!"

While I was hesitant to book initially based on the overall rating from previous guests, I decided to overlook and book based on the good comments from the larger majority. I’m glad we booked with David for our family Christmas in Fresno. The house was perfect for our needs and David was super kind by providing us with a Christmas tree in the house as a surprise!!!! We had the opportunity to meet him in person and he was just as kind and genuine as he presented himself in chat communication. It’s evident that he wants his guests to enjoy their stay at his home. We made great family memories here and David was nothing short of a stellar host!"

Stayed over a week","BEWARE GUESTS: David sadly is not the honest host I thought he was. He found out my insurance company was paying for our stay and brought up the idea to go around airbnb and pay through his other business so he wouldnt have to pay airbnb fees etc, be very careful when dealing with him he tries to confuse and trick people into booking his place, I truly believe he made a fake booking for himself of his place then 3 minutes later said the person canceled and that now I should hurry to book before someone else does, so obvious he made this fake booking. Also.. make sure he doesnt give you the same access door code the last guest used, that is dangerous and he did that with us until I asked him to change it. Lastly...the neighbor has a big dog that doesnt stop barking day and night. David lies good so just be careful and dont say I didn't warn you."

The checkin and checkout processes are very easy, and David is always quick to respond and will touch base to make sure you have everything you need. I am familiar with the Fresno/Clovis area, and this is indeed a very nice neighborhood and close to grocery stores, restaurants, whatever you need.

Group trip","Dissapointed in this 2nd booking with David. He promised us days he never came through with. I was somehow charged without getting the promised days in our booking, after that david completely ignored my messages and my refund request. I am also convinced david makes his own fake bookings and then tells his customers he will get the the fake booking canceled for them. He seems to only care about money. Be careful in dealing with him. There is also a loud dog next door that seems to bark 24/7. Look for other honest host to stay with.,"

Stayed a few nights","Location was less than an hour from King’s Canyon entrance. Great walkability - only a couple blocks from coffee shops, restaurants, bars, and brewery.
The AC was strong and necessary in the hot summer. Felt very safe with the secured keypads on the front gate and studio door itself. Street parking was very easy to find. The hosts were amazing with communication. Would book again!"

Stayed one night","We are boring travelers that go to sleep at 9 and when other people in the building arrived at night it was very noisy. There is also a club across the road that you can hear slightly.
Please if you live there respect the rule of no shoes inside, it gets very noisy.
Hao was responsive and great, it makes me sad to give them a not 5 star review, but I was really tired and did not get much sleep there.
Important to note - it was Saturday, other days can be different."

Stayed a few nights","This is a perfect spot to land as a travel nurse picking up a few shifts in town! It was SUPER clean, quiet, and very conveniently located. Super close to multiple hospitals and walkable to a bunch of great restaurants. Jenny and Hao were very responsive and helpful, and even left me some coffee which I greatly appreciated!
It was so nice to come back to an extra clean and comfortable spot after some busy, long shifts. I also felt it was very secure with the gated building and multiple ways to lock my personal door. I felt just fine walking to get food by myself so it’s not a bad neighborhood at all but I appreciated the extra security.
I wasted money at a “higher end” hotel downtown which felt dangerous and dirty before coming here and I for sure wish I had come to Jenny and Hao’s first! I can highly recommend to others and will definitely book again!"

Stayed a few nights","Best value we have ever experienced in an AirBNB. This home had high end amenities that rival a 4-5 star hotel. Kitchen was spacious with included coffee bar. Fridge has soda and water.
Owner left a bottle of wine and a homemade cheesecake! Yum! Master bath has huge walk-in closet. Shower has mosaic tile and was luxurious. Absolutely high-end everything. Soaring ceilings. Not to mention the backyard is resort-like with a humongous concrete pool, water feature and garden. Patio has wonderful gas fireplace with seating area.
Owner was fast and responsive and even brought in a recliner chair for my elderly mother to use during our stay. Early check-in was granted after traveling all day, and we extended an extra day with no problem. Key code entry was convenient.
My wife and I always stay in an AirBNB when we travel and by far this was the best experience. This owner tried the hardest to for guests to be comfortable, and it shows with the thoughtful touches.
Thank you Yadira!!"

I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for such a wonderful Airbnb experience at your property. From the moment I arrived, I was impressed by the cleanliness, brightness, and peaceful ambiance of the place. It truly felt like a home away from home.
Your attention to detail in providing everything a guest might need did not go unnoticed. The proximity to the freeways made exploring the area effortless, and yet the quiet atmosphere of the neighborhood was a welcome retreat after a long day of adventures.
Additionally, your responsiveness and friendliness as a host made the entire experience even more enjoyable. Knowing that I could reach out to you with any questions or concerns put my mind at ease.
I look forward to the opportunity to stay at your property again in the future.

Stayed a few nights","We stayed there from Thurs to Tue. As soon as we checked in the room, we smelled a foul odor. We looked around and found a tray of grease in the fridge. The burning grease smell was unbearable. Our eyes sting due to that. We contacted the host. They sent someone to clean the fridge, but the smell was so bad that they had to replace the whole fridge. However, the stench lingered throughout our stay. We had to close the bedroom door. T,he host admitted that they were thawing some meat prior to our arrival and failed to clean it. Despite the admission, that was a negligence that shouldn't have happened. Trash cans have no lids in the bedroom or bathroom, especially in the kitchen. However, everything else is satisfactory."

Stayed a few nights","Overall, this was a very nice place. Nicely furnished, attractive, clean and in a very nice, quiet neighborhood. The only thing that made this less then excellent was that the description said it had a full kitchen and that was not the case. There is a mini fridge, microwave, toaster and coffee maker. Almost no freezer space and nowhere to actually cook anything. There was minimal actual kitchen supplies although there were some paper plates and plastic utensils. I travel for work and bring most of my food. It would have been nice to be able to fry an egg. If you don't plan to do anything more than heating things up in the microwave this place would be perfect and the price was very reasoable."

Stayed a few nights","Before even booking the listing I had contacted Kristie to see if it would be okay for me and my mom to checkout of the room a bit later than 11am (1:30pm) She agreed, but then the day of checkout she rudely confronted my mother telling he she needed to be out by 11am. I was working at the time and couldn’t get to my phone in time to see what was going on. Luckily we do have some relatives near by that my mother could stay with when she was kicked out but I just thought it was incredibly rude of Kristie to go back on her word of allowing us to check out by 1:30pm as opposed to 11am. This place also had tons of ants in the bathroom, some even making their way into the kitchen. Honestly not the best, I was most upset by how she treated my mother. I’d check on other places before coming here."

It's really well kept and clean, it's quite big, the bed was really comfortable. You have access to a private bathroom/restroom and a small kitchen. We'd definitely recommend this airbnb"

The house is in a very well kept neighborhood. It was not too far from the airport. The check-in/out process were both a breeze. We were able to park right outside the guesthouse door. One night during our stay the power went out in the guesthouse. Kristie had the problem fixed almost immediately after I sent her a message! She was also very respectful of our privacy. I would absolutely recommend Kristie’s place to anyone looking for a simple and comfortable AirBnB!"

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay here! We were in Fresno for two nights to visit Sequoia and Kings Canyon. Kristie’s place served as a great location and value for our trip. We really enjoyed how cool and comfortable the suite was after a long day of hiking in the sun. Allowing guests to park in the drive was very appreciated, giving us easy access to the suite. Though the suite is technically attached to the home, you don’t feel like you’re staying inside of someone’s home whatsoever. The stay felt very private and the bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom were all kept very clean.
I especially appreciated Kristie’s attentiveness during the check in process- it made it super easy and clear. Our stay was during the week leading up to the 4th of July, so we found that the neighbors really enjoyed their fireworks at night. Other than that, the neighborhood was very pretty and pleasant. We appreciated the opportunity to stay here and would recommend to anyone considering!"

While the neighborhood was an alright place for Fresno I did feel safe at the location. If I also came back to Fresno I would definitely stay with them again. The host was very accommodating to a timeline that I had for a wedding. They also respond almost immediately to any concern or question you may have and it was definitely helpful.

Stayed one night","The place is centrallylocatedin the heart of Tower which is great if you want access its entertainment district. It literally is in walking distance from Olive where all the restaurants and bars are located. I used to live in this part of Fresno for nearly 8 years. The owners have taken what used to be a dump run by a slum lord and turned it into a really nice spot! It is clean, comfy and has wonderful air conditioning; a huge bonus for staying in Fresno in the Central Valley's desperately hot, dry summers.. The locked door to the building is an added bonus! It is evident they have taken great care in the remodeling of these units and as the town's tag line says, they ""Believe in Downtown"". Cheers to you guys! This will be my go-to when coming back for future visit"

The backyard is designed so well - lots of walls/benches embedded with lighting, dining area perfect distance to yard and house, stylish pool/spa, all surrounded by lawn, tall trees, and colorful flowers. The hosts communicated with us very well and made us feel welcomed. We would definitely return and recommend this place to others."

As I walked in I found myself enveloped in an enchanting ambience, where every corner whispered tales of the past, yet embraced the comforts of the present.
The fusion of modern amenities and timeless craftsmanship was nothing short of mesmerizing. From a living room flooding with natural light during the day, offering stunning views of the beautifully adorned backyard at night.
The backyard emanates a luxurious resort ambiance, boasting a bonfire corner, a jacuzzi, and a generously sized pool that perfectly complement the meticulously landscaped yardwork. It's a harmonious blend of indulgence and natural beauty—an oasis that exceeds all expectations.
Amidst the grandeur lingers an undeniable sense of intimacy—a feeling that this space has been lovingly crafted. I have found my home away from home!"

Stayed about a week","I am an architect, and like many of my colleagues, I find it hard to locate rentals where the place and furniture match my design sensibilities. Tania's house in Fresno was perfect in this regard, a beautifully and sensibly restored house, with the right balance between old midcentury design and some new pieces that reflect the era in a more contemporary way. My family and I felt at home in minutes. It was like we would have furnished the house ourselves. The garden and outdoor areas are also very tastefully designed. The whole house felt like a modernist gesamtkunstwerk that you usually only get in curated boutique hotels. The pool was the biggest attraction for the kids, and it has a great size so that you can also swim (it looks smaller on the photos). The communication and service were also flawless. This was a great AirB&B experience, and I will recommended the house to all my friends and colleagues."

Kitchen was spotless, had all dining/cooking supplies and utensils, had a massive fridge, and ice machine. Living room had a beautiful fire place, nice couch, record player and games. The master bathroom was SUPER state of the art and gorgeous. The toilet was incredible, had a seat warmer, a bidet, and hands free controls. Hoise decor was incredible too. Backyard was MASSIVE, private, very open, excellent landscaping, and truly pleasant. Tania, the host was exceptionally helpful, always available, and wonderful to work with.

My 12 yr old son and I had a blast here!
My son is medically fragile, so the house was perfect for us as we tend to be more home body’s these days due to the nature of his condition..
Being here felt like we were at a retreat!😲
It felt extremely, peaceful and warm in every way..
It truly started to feel like “home” shortly after being here..🥲
The neighborhood is absolutely charming, calm and beautiful!! We SOOO sooooo loved it!!!!
We were able to go on a short walk to the end of the street, and it’s absolutely stunning !🌲 🍂🍁
I actually think this place is even more incredible in person in every way.. WOW!!

We were in town because our son had a few appointments at valley childrens. It was a stressful visit but Tania went above and beyond to accommodate us.

Not only is Vaness a great street to walk, the home itself is walkable to the Annex (one of Fresno’s best restaurants). Aside from the home’s timeless mid-century modern architecture and stylings, the massive backyard is reason enough to book. Beautifully landscaped, with a resort style pool and jacuzzi, the yard provides a peaceful setting. We already miss the nights sitting in the jacuzzi and watching the stars. The house itself is perfectly clean and comfortably furnished. All three beds are very comfortable and each room has its own tv! The master suite is large with a recently renovated bathroom. The shower is large with amazing water pressure. Finally, we appreciated having a large washing machine and dryer. Thank you Tania! Already looking forward to our next visit!"

Too many AirBnBs look nice but the hosts cut corners with things like mattresses, bedding and towels. Not Tania! These beds were so comfortable. My only regret is that our toddler didn't want to let us sleep in more!
At first glance, the kitchen will seem dated, but all appliances are modern and top of the line and it had all we needed for our stay. The neighborhood is quiet, safe and lovely to stroll through -- the mature trees were in full autumnal mode during our trip."

Stayed with kids","Tania's place was absolutely beautiful and so stylish. That, and it was just super cozy. We loved that each bedroom had a smart, wall-mounted TV, the remote controlled fireplace in the living room was awesome, the pool and hot tub were great and the yard was so well landscaped. Tania was super responsive and my family and I were kicking ourselves that we hadn't booked two nights. One thing to note, though gorgeous (and with a crazy fancy/fun bidet toilet) the master bathroom doesn't have a door to close it off from the master bedroom. Just something to be aware of depending on who you may be sleeping with in that room or what your comfort level is with that scenario. We just wound up walking down the hall to use the bathroom when we were both in the room together. It's not a reason for us not to rent this place again. Will definitely be back next time we visit our Fresno family. Thanks!"

Stayed a few nights","Wow! Just wow, if you come across this booking, don’t hesitate, do yourself a favour and just book it!
My two co workers and I shared the space for two nights and let’s just say we were treated to the true epitome of OASIS! The rooms, the details, the thoughtful touches, the design and style just made for an incredible stay.
I love mid century design and architecture and they knocked it out of the park with the finishes and making it modern but totally nostalgically lux. I didn’t want to leave.
The property, pool, landscaping, loungers, bbq, was all too good to be true, but it is and certainly was for us.
Smooth and easy contactless check in, we felt like we had the most amazing hosts that we never even met, but the communication was so good , we felt like we did.
I cannot wait to come back as a destination in and of itself.
Whole Foods as well as a bunch of other shops are conveniently located nearby for your needs.
One of the best Airbnbs I’ve ever stayed!"

Stayed one night",Our stay was great. Everything was fabulous. Her house provided lots of amenities for us and more. Our favorite part about our stay was that there was a washer and dryer included. Our host provided so much for us. She was amazing. We also loved the big Jacuzzi tub in the bathroom. Each room was very spacious and everything was so clean and it smelled amazing.

Stayed with kids","Sabrina's house was really nice and quaint and we enjoyed our short stay there. The house was clean and well kept but for a few things :
1. The floor was very slippery and moist and my sister had a small slipping accident because of that.
2. The Fan and the Light switch in the Living Room couldn't be found so we couldn't use that room for watching TV.
Last but not least, the train noise could be disturbing if you are not a sound sleeper."

Stayed one night",Everything was great my only complaint is there's no dishes- no silverware so it was challenging in fact it was not a good place to stay if you plan to stay a few days. No hangers which was another obstacle to me. Maybe she could have a few plates and bowls that are microwavable and silverware for guests to use. Airbnb should be a place away from home but more like a second home and not like hotels. Hotels at least has plenty of towels and hangers. Also the towels were wet so it was kind of gross.

Each room is set up like a hotel. The pool and jacuzzi wasn't available but she offered a refund. It will be ready when I come back in a week. The neighborhood is very peaceful and beautiful to walk. I had an issue with my shower and it was replaced the next day. I'm a travel nurse and I will be staying here every time I come to Fresno.

This area is very quiet and have great neighbors. Steve and I had great communication. He responded quickly to any questions or concerns that we had. We were suppose to stay here only a week but Steve let us extend our stay for a few days more. We were happy about that cause we had a lot of stuff to pack and didn't want to leave just to go somewhere else. So that was a big plus for us. The place was clean and spacious. I would definitely stay here again if we get the chance. Don't pass up on this one, you will love it. A++"

Stayed one night","If you’re looking for a cheap place to stay for a short period of time - this place will work out. That being said, I would not recommend booking this stay if you have a family or if you are staying for a longer period of time. It is in a very very bad part of town (confirmed by the many cops outside the house the night of our stay as well as gun shots heard). There was lots of noice from other guest and loud music playing at all out of the night and lots of odd smells. I was kind of expecting that based on the price, which is why I said it would work out for a quick stay, but again I would not stay here with children or for longer than one night. The owners did make it easy to check in and out and the place was nicely decorated."

The place wasn't just clean and matching the picture-perfect images online, but it also offered a high level of comfort and privacy, making it feel like a home away from home. Additionally, the convenience of parking on the street without any hassle and the easy access to the highway made my stay all the more enjoyable. This combination of comfort, cleanliness, privacy, and convenience truly made my Airbnb experience outstanding."

Stayed a few nights","The room was great, good size and the private restroom was perfect since I hate sharing showers.
Now on the other part the fan of the room had no control so I had to leave the windows open. it’s a bit noisy cause of the area and the other people staying at the time so you can hear them walking down stairs. the room doors have space between the floor so it doesn’t help much for the noise.
What did get on my nerves was the disrespect of whoever stood there and ate my food that I left in the fridge. Who ever it was ripped my bag and ate my stuff like wtf.. other than that I will stay again even though they’re zombies walking around the street at night/morning and some weird people were staying there. It’s Fresno not the air bnbs fault just wished they screened the people who stay there a bit better."

Stayed one night","The house is nicely refurbished and decorated but:
There is a kitchen but hardly any plates, cooking pans, … so it is not duper useful.
We were freezing at night because the house has an centeal AC unit which is controlled in the hallway. The vent in the room cant be shut entirely.
There was a strong cigarette scent coming from another room, we had to fill up the 2 inch gap under the bedroom door for the smell and privacy as well.
There were loud noises until 1 am and again from 5 am so we hardly had a good night sleep (the bed itself was good).
People coming in and out the house all the time, not even sure if they were guests of the house…
The intention of the rental is really good, but did not work out for us."

Stayed one night","The host was extremely responsive to our requests, and we appreciated the mini-website for the property, which is really well done and assist you upon your arrival and during your stay with several useful info.
However, it didn't mention that two doors are found at that house, and somehow the wrong (white) one attracted us more, maybe because the keypad was more visible on that one, meaning we tried entering in the wrong property.
We were a bit disappointed by the ""hostel"" feeling, we were expecting to be hosted by people living there, instead we shared our stay with other strangers (some of them quite noisy at night).
The neighborhood didn't make us feel very safe. While the street itself seemed fine, there were a couple of drunk junkies outside of a laundry nearby."

The beautiful old world lure, of the 1920's craftsman style home nestled, in the historical Old Fresno / BOHO area is updated and restored fabulously. The large front porch is a great place for an early morning cup of coffee, The Kitchen is large, and well equipped. The ""minimalist"" design base delivers a clutter free, comfy, relaxing environment with the owners personal touch to the ambience and aesthetics, this home delivers more than any other I've stayed in so far and even more than AirBnB has room for in their description box. It's a must see! I decided to come back and stay a whole month, I liked it so much! Don't miss out on these huge luxurious rooms for your next stay in Fresno!"

Inside, the house wowed us with its sleek design and functional layout. The open-concept living/dining/kitchen area was both visually stunning and practical for gatherings. Every corner exuded comfort and style, with impeccable cleanliness and new appliances.
What truly made our experience exceptional was the hosts' attention to detail. From the fully equipped kitchen to the lightning-fast internet and Smart TVs with Netflix, every amenity exceeded our expectations. The seamless check-in process and attentive hosts ensured we had a memorable stay.
In summary, I wholeheartedly recommend this property for its comfort, convenience, and hospitality. Thank you to the hosts for an unforgettable experience – we can't wait to return!

We were simply looking for a place to stay for the week (4 nights) but Emilio's place was much more than that! Super clean, with everything you need at your fingertips. Backyard has a BBQ and fire pit w/ soft seating to lounge around. What I really liked was that the house was clutter free... kitchen drawers only had what was necessary, and not a drawer full of multiple/random cooking tools, or the pantry with just enough kitchen appliances.
Even though the house had EVERYTHING we needed, Emilio still emailed us after the first night to make sure we had everything we needed. The neighborhood is quiet, and at no time was our safety compromised. The garage was available for us to park in as well, to avoid our car sitting in the blazing heat. High highly recommend!"

Unfortunately, it wasn’t very clean and we had 6-7 houseflies in the kitchen and bathroom. It made having meals at the dining table challenging. I killed a couple with a towel. I wasn’t sure why there were flies until we checked out and I found the outside black trash bin was filled to the brim until it couldn’t close.
A simple issue to fix, especially for future guests, but an unfortunate stain on our experience."

All were easy drives within 1.5-2.5 hours. We loved the back yard space which is like a private retreat. The house was super clean and it was nice to be able to wash clothes in the new washer and dryer. Would highly recommend. Only regret is that we didn’t spend as much time at the house due to traveling to parks, etc. We’ll definitely rent again next time in the area."

The house was immaculate. It’s obvious as soon as you walk in that all of the furniture, appliances, and the electronics in the house are high quality pieces. The beds, chairs, and couches were incredibly comfy, the rooms were spacious, and neighborhood beautiful.
The house was incredibly clean and organized and the host Emilio was succinct, kind, and un-intrusive. Will definitely book again in the future at this price. Thanks Emilio!"

Stayed with kids","First of all i wanted to say . what a clean organized house. whoever steve hires for cleaning needs a raise !Everything was meticulously thought of. The house had everything you needed, home away from home. Even the landscape was just perfect and beautiful. We came to visit family& it was perfect for our family especially traveling with a baby . Only sad part i couldn’t have my little puppy with me. it would’ve been nice to have her there But good thing she was able to stay at a familys home close by. And maybe a tv in the master bedroom. overall this might have to be the house to stay when we are all in town. Thank you again Steve for opening up your home& welcoming us the moment we walked in. It was in a safe quiet neighborhood."

We had cleaned out his home of more than 20 years and wanted a nice haven to enjoy our last night together before taking him there. It was the perfect place for this. The home is absolutely beautiful. The soaking tub was a perfect place to wash off the day in relaxing tranquility, and the backyard is so inviting with a lovely pool, tons of palm trees and lush greenery. The ambiance of string lights were the perfect touch. The neighborhood is great with lots of old growth trees and well manicured lawns. We felt very safe the entire stay. This will be my TOP choice home to stay in when I come in to town to visit dad. Thank you Steve for being a great host!! Did I mention the ping pong table?"
