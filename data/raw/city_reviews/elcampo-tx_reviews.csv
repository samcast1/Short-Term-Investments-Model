Stayed a few nights","Tim was friendly and helpful. He met us as we drove up, which was great. He had a map made up of the area, so that we could find all the sights. Also he had a document explaining how everything worked in the house, so it was a very easy entry and enjoyable stay. On top of this he had bought us a bouquet for our Anniversary. It was lovely. Beautiful, quiet surroundings. Ten stars for everything!"

Stayed a few nights","If you're anywhere near the Bay City/ Palacious , TX area you won't want to miss the Carriage House Retreat. It's wonderfully and carefully appointed, very neat, spotlessly clean, and super comfortable. I stayed there alone, but it would work great for two people as well. Tim is super friendly, shares info about local attractions, and is available for help. He also is very respectful of privacy and lets you have the space to enjoy. The pictures don't do this place justice. I was there for R & R, and to do some birding. It was perfect on both counts. I brought all my food, and the kitchen lacked nothing for meal prep. They even have an air fryer. I highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","We chose this spot as it was closer to Palacios than Bay City. (Palacios was the central location for the Matagorda Bird Festival that we were attending.) The price was right, and we liked the cancellation policy which was generous. Also the lack of a cleaning fee was a big plus.
We were happy with the spaciousness of the lodging. The lighting was good and the whole place was spotless. The kitchen decor and appliances were in excellent condition.
There were several snacks, bottled water, even a few single service portions of breakfast cereal, and a small bottle of milk available. We had picked up take out BBQ in Bay City, and all the plates, silverware, glasses were handy as was the dishwasher and dish soap if needed. The only thing I wished there had been was a glass microwaveable dish, but there were microwaveable bowls available.
I always worry that hosts will be hovering, but Tim showed us around upon arrival and then left us alone.
We will stay there again if in the area."

Stayed a few nights",Tim was a wonderful host. He was there when we arrived to show us around and to answer any questions we had which was very helpful. The guesthouse is beautifully decorated and has pretty much everything you may need when you're away from home. It just has one bedroom which has a very comfortable king-size bed to sleep in. The water flow during showers is perfect. Not too weak or strong. The guest house can sleep four but I feel like it is suited better for just two people. A great getaway place for two!

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful carriage house with lots of space and all you need for a stress-free home away from home experience. Nestled just off the road, the wooded area was fantastic for local bird watching and the nature trail was lovely anytime of day. The carriage house is perfectly situated close to three small towns with their own unique things to do, but best of all, it is only 20 minutes from Palacios and a gorgeous park right on the Matagorda Bay! There is even a fenced area for a dog and the stuff to light a fire in a fire pit and enjoy the stars. Tim was a welcoming host and I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again!"

The hospitality was amazing! It is in a safe location and is surrounded by beautiful trees and feels so peaceful. We will be staying here again next time we visit! I wish we would have been able to stay a couple extra nights just to be able to relax and enjoy the outdoors. Grill some food and make some s’mores with the kids at night with the fire pit. So thankful I found this place. Made our trip so much more enjoyable."

Stayed one night","Tim’s place was spectacularly spacious and peaceful. The layout was perfect for my partner and I to unwind. With Aretha Franklin playing on the record player, the living room quickly felt homey. The space in the cooking area was helpfully open come dinner time, and the washer/dryer came in hand when we spilt said dinner on ourselves. The snacks that Tim and his wife left in the bread box were simply perfect for movie night, and the little amenities we found in the cabinets couldn’t have made us feel more welcomed. The stay was more than what we expected, and we truly enjoyed our time, although too short. We will be definitely booking in the future, and couldn’t be more excited to come back."

Stayed over a week","We stayed at this beautiful place for almost 3 weeks. Tim was very accommodating and allowed us to have our doggie Agatha with us. The apartment is one of the best airbnb we have stayed at (and we have been to quite a few). All the amenities were top of the line. In most Airbnb you get the spare items from the owners home or things like that. Not here. Washer, dryer, kitchen appliances, furniture and bedroom set were great. The bed is really comfortable, hotel style comfortable I would say. The place was also spot clean and you have all you need to do your own cleaning if you feel like. Internet is really fast, We actually worked everyday remotely without issues, considering my job demands VPN connection and advanced graphics. The surroundings of the property are nice as well. There is a little trail (about 10 min) in the premises of property where you can go for a walk and decompress. Matagorda Beach is 35 min away, which we visited a few times and you can get some restaurants in Palacios (15 min away) or Bay City (20 min away). If you are looking for a place to stay in the area, don't look any further."

They have extra linens so you can pick what you prefer and a wonderful king size bed! We arrived on Valentine's day and had a gift bag of candy to welcome us.

I enjoyed taking walks along the gulf (one option is about 30 min away). Another day I went to the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge which is about 1 hour and 15 min away; it offers several short hikes that I enjoyed. That obviously is a bit of a journey but I am very glad I did it. There is a very nice short path through the woods on their property for those not looking for such a long car ride to get outdoors."

I kept coming back out just to ensure I covered every inch of the amenities and amazing views. You will love to have your coffee or tea in one of many areas to sit outdoors! On the inside it was so well decorated and thought out. It felt so cozy and comfortable. She has the friendliest animals that love all the attention too near the property and within reach! We honestly could not believe how perfect it all came out to be. From the service, to the local wineries and markets close to town. An experience we will never forget. Kathy and her husband opened their doors to such an amazing place. Thank you!"

My daughters loved petting the horses and feeding the goats! They also loved the pond, play area, hot tub and discovered a love of fishing. My husband enjoyed the fire circle and bbq pit. I loved the hammock and comfortable bed! The weekend is exactly what this momma’s heart needed!
Kathy and Jeff were extremely hospitable, greeted us upon arrival and even provided goodies for our girls, a wagon to get our gear down easily and a surprise bottle of wine and rose petals in our bedroom.
Everything is so thought out, Kathy has a heart for hosting guest! This was our second visit and we will definitely be back again soon!"

Photos don’t do it justice. From the moment you enter the gate, you feel transformed into a heavenly fairytale. If you need peace and relaxation, book this place!
And the property, my gosh! It’s just as beautiful!
I cannot wait to come back. I’m missing Phoenix (the gorgeous horse on property) already!
Thank you, Kathy."

I will definitely be looking to return."

Stayed a few nights","We had an extremely cosy, private getaway at Kathy's place. It's just far enough away from neighboring cities to feel truly out in the country, but close enough to be easily accessible. There are several cute small towns nearby that offer decent dining options and sightseeing opportunities. The cabin itself is very cosy and well-equipped, with everything you need to prepare food, soak in the hot tub, or just sit around an open fire. Kathy was very friendly, communicative, and left several personal touches for our arrival that we appreciated. We look forward to coming back here again before too long!!"

Stayed a few nights","The serenity of this cabin was incredible! Being out in the country, there was no road noise. We loved sitting on the swing at the end of the pond, listening to the fountain, the birds, and occasionally the horses and goats. Kathy provided detailed directions to the cabin (Waze works in the country!) and she and her husband greeted us at arrival. As the parking is about 30 yards from the cabin and it was raining when we arrived, Kathy's husband helped load our luggage into a cart and delivered it to the front door. A huge blessing! My husband and I are older travelers (70+) and I've had some recent health scares, so having our hosts' home within 80 yards was reassuring for us. They completed respected our privacy. The cabin is beautifully decorated and cozy for 2 people. Cereal, blueberry bread, pancade mix, farm-fresh eggs, coffee, and juice were all provided for our breakfast. If you're searching for a quiet retreat with a focus on the outdoors, this is it!"

Stayed one night","We stayed in Fawn Creek Cabin, which is on a 20-acre farm. A delight with gentle farm animals: a horse, a pony and goats. The animals are quite used to visitors and like to be petted, and of course fed. Our hosts provided biscuits for them. They also provided plenty for us: snacks and breakfast eggs and cereal, and a bottle of wine. We might have had dinner, too, from the catfish in the pond right outside our door   
The cabin itself is quite nice. One bedroom and bath, kitchen, streaming TV and strong internet. The decor is contemporary/traditional everything looks fresh and new. We really enjoyed the fireplace in the bedroom they provide a long burning log with extra wood.There is also a hot tub on the porch.
The cabin is close to the Painted Churches of Texas and plenty of unique restaurants.

We have been to good ones, BUT THIS LITTLE GEM WAS BY FAR THE BEST WE HAVE BEEN TO.
I feel I shouldn’t give away too many details, to ensure a natural reaction for all who come after #US.
Kathy is AMAZING!!! I had a last minute romantic surprise request for my lady, and Kathy was so kind to have put something together for her before we arrived. ❤️
Smile, but Beautiful!
The property is secluded and was a literal BREATH of FRESH AIR. 😮‍💨🧘‍♀️ 🧘‍♂️
First time feeding farm animals and it was therapeutic for me personally. My lady was all smiles!
We hope y’all get the opportunity to experience this little slice of heaven & serenity!"

The weather was beautiful and cool in the evenings so we had a campfire and used the hot tub both evenings. The pond is a great place to relax and make sure you feed the catfish! We also had fun feeding the goats and horses. This is an excellent location for a couples getaway. Thank you so much Kathy! We had a great time."

Stayed with kids","I can’t say enough about Fawn Creek. My daughters and I stayed there the weekend of the freeze. We planned on 1 night but the cabin was just too cozy to leave. When we arrived, there was a sign welcoming us, sweet homemade treats and the fridge had fresh eggs and milk. Oh and did I mention the bottle of wine for me? :)
When we arrived, the girls quickly fell in love with the two horses, Phoenix & Feather 🩷
I found this sweet spot bc I wanted to fish with the girls. My local bait shop was out of worms and Kathy found me a spot in Weimar in 2 seconds flat with all the goods! And boy did we catch some catfish in that pond! First time for me to catch alone and take off the hook. They were like little sharks 😂
The fishing, the animals, the cozy cabin, the hot tub, the fire pit, the fireplace in the bedroom…all of it we used and appreciated so much.
Book this gem. You won’t be disappointed. And thank you Kathy so so much for everything! We’ll definitely be back!"

They were super friendly, we loved feeding them with the treats Kathy left for us and you can go in and pet/take pictures with them. The pond was beautiful. It was relaxing to sit and just take in the surroundings. They leave fishing poles and food for the fish that you can use. We used the fire pit twice and it was nice to sit around it and chat at night. The hot tub was enjoyable as well. The inside of the cabin is very neat and gives off such a modern, cozy, cabin feeling. The kitchen and bathroom were excellent. Overall it was a pretty magical experience and would 100% recommend to someone who wants to get away and enjoy sometime outside of the city surrounded by trees."

The cabin was decorated for the holidays and it felt very cozy and comfortable. We would love to come back again and take advantage of more of the amenities (we didnt find time to use the fire pit or feed the farm animals). Note that you should coordinate your arrival time with Kathy as she will pre-heat the hot tub for you!"

We were blown away by all of the little details that made our stay so perfect from the little coffee cake waiting for us in the kitchen to the chocolate covered strawberries with wine on our rose petal covered bed (we were celebrating our anniversary and thanksgiving in one). Our boys (ages 8 and 11) loved the animals and enjoyed getting treats from the treat bucket to feed them and pet them. We all enjoyed the outdoor games like corn hole, horseshoes, roasting s’mores at the fire pit, relaxing in the hot tub, feeding the fish in the fish pond and then coming inside to relax and play games. It was seriously the most cozy, tranquil stay!! The perfect escape during our holiday break. We are already dreaming of going back next year!

Stayed with kids","Very friendly and thoughtful hosts. There were sweet extras and unexpected touches not mentioned that brought a nice surprise to our stay. Perfect for animal lovers, but also far enough away and separated from the animals that if that’s not your thing then you can just see from afar. Everything smells really good which is a big thing for me, but also no overpowering fragrances trying to hide anything (I hope that makes sense). Kathy seems to have thought of everything and maintained her availability for questions, but I didn’t have any.
The pillows and bed were very comfortable.
We brought two children ages 8 and 10 and they both really enjoyed the opportunity to get up close to the friendly animals at the fence line. They fed the fish in the stocked pond and loved the corn hole, fort and sandbox on the property. I would definitely recommend this place for a romantic getaway or a small family retreat.

All the details that they had put into it. Was truly amazing. We had the best hosts ever. As soon as we walked to the door we had our names greeted on a sign. Wine and chocolate covered strawberries in the bedroom with rose petals all over the bed. And let me tell you the bed was awesome. Kathy even made me birthday pastries that were so good. I'm still craving them. It was just the sweetest thing to walk into. Everything was super clean I mean extremely clean. Every detail that they Put everywhere was just amazing I can't tell you how good the detail was in everything. The animals were extremely friendly and we enjoyed every bit of it. We got to give the horses and goats treats. We also got to feed the fish. The pond is full of catfish. I fished all day one of the days. We caught over sixty catfish. we loved this place!!!! 100stars"

Kathy gave our daughter a toy horse that looks just like the horse there. The personal touches were sweet. Definitely recommend!

Stayed a few nights","This is the BEST Airbnb that I have ever stayed. The cabin was exactly as describe and the surroundings (including the goats, horses and I think it was a pheasant) certainly made it PERFECT.
The cabin is nothing less that 6-star! Kathy makes sure that you have absolutely everything that you could possibly need and even provided fresh chicken eggs, which came in handy when we cooked hamburger on the grill provided on the patio by the hot tub. The bedroom was so romantic and she even covered the bed in rose petals and left us chocolate covered strawberries and wine.
Overall - this is the 'weekend escape' that you do not want to escape. All of the pictures are 100% legit and Kathy even met us when we pulled up to explain everything. I can't say enough good things about this property."

From the personal touches she put into the place for my husband and I to the provided food and coffee and stuff to make s’mores. Wine and chocolate covered strawberries. It was all so perfect! I never wanted to leave. The hot tub was amazing and I loved the pond and the porch swing by the pond to sit and spend time with each other. It was so peaceful there. I loved getting to know the mini horse, horse and goats. If you are looking to escape the city and experience peace this is the place! We never had to leave the property.

The cleanliness and coziness of the place exceeded our expectations, with a particularly stunning bathroom design. The hot tub offered a relaxing way to unwind under the stars at night.
Kathy was a delightful host who provided excellent recommendations for nearby restaurants and clear directions to the Airbnb.
Overall, our stay was an incredibly enjoyable and rejuvenating experience. I would not hesitate to book this Airbnb again and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a tranquil getaway."

Kathy was extremely friendly and personable. It was great to get the opportunity to meet her and Jeff during our stay at the Fawn Creek cabin. My wife and I were looking to get away before I start a big career shift, and I’m so grateful we chose Fawn Creek as the spot to go enjoy, as it was even more beautiful than the pictures indicate. The beauty and attention to detail throughout the cabin were remarkable, notably the addition of the small stained glass window above the master bed and the wonderfully well stocked coffee bar. These amenities truly added a colorful, caffeinated and vibrant touch to a warm, relaxing weekend away. Thank you for your quick accommodation and over the top customer service, Kathy. We will certainly be back and will continue to spread the word on this beautiful cabin getaway that is Fawn Creek.

Stayed with kids","This adorable little retreat in the woods combines everything you may love about a hotel with everything you’re looking for in an Airbnb: a unique, personalized, private stay with hotel-like cleanliness, amenities and service. Kathy appears to be a natural-born hostess, from her lightning fast responsiveness and friendly down-home greeting upon arrival, to the most detailed touches she’s left throughout the property — including fresh baked bread, farm eggs, fresh milk, a s’mores kit, and so much more.
My husband and I visited for a short weekend with our four year-old and never left the property. Plenty to do, especially if you’re craving a country escape. We fed the goats, horses and fish (with food provided by Kathy), roasted hotdogs and s’mores at the fire pit, brought binoculars to watch the deer come eat at dawn and dusk, and enjoyed time in the hot tub. Our daughter enjoyed the playground and sandbox, and also enjoyed riding her scooter along the paved path."

Sure hated to leave this morning!! Cleaned up the little cabin like it belonged to me … pretty sure I left parts of my heart there!!
I/we needed this time away! You don’t realize the heaviness of life you carry around with you -until- you unplug, unwind, (all the “un’s”) and feel that weight come off your shoulders and set your mind free.
For me, my soul is the happiest whenever I find myself in the hill country .. must be my parental heritage that calls me homeward!
I literally soaked in the warm breeze all around me, the sights and sounds of nature and her wildlife that scampered around finding their own bliss in God’s buffet of earthly manna!!
It’s in that “grounding” affect that centers me to my core! God made a beautiful earth and we miss so much of His blessings by not getting outside more, and slowing down to appreciate the sunshine and natural dopamine that wraps you up solid!!

Uhmmm, well . . . Y E S

Stayed a few nights","This was one of the best Airbnbs that we have stayed at. Kathy and Jeff's attention to detail was perfect. Everything that you needed was thought of and then some. It was a very relaxing stay away from the stresses of the city. The animals (Phoenix the horse, herd of goats and the guinea) were an added bonus. We also caught several catfish from the pond and enjoyed the fire pit area along with the hot tub. If you're looking for a place to unwind, you can't go wrong with this one. Only word of advice is to follow Kathy's direction to the cabin, don't rely in the GPS because it could take you to the old oil road instead."

Pictures are exact but must see in person to appreciate. It is very peaceful and clean. The horse and goats are well kept and are very special ( more pet like). Land is very well kept and does not smell. Many options for scenery for being secluded and private ( very spacious and private from owners house). The pond is well kept and stocked ( turtles, minnow, fish, frogs. Not an ordinary pond, beautiful. With plenty of outdoor seating options from swing bench to a hammock. Great play area clean and safe. Hot tub and fire pit are a must. The warm welcome of fresh cinnamon cake and fresh milk were perfect!"

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely beautiful place! This place is so special❤️. You will not regret booking here, I promise. There isn’t enough room on this page to give the amazing review that this cabin deserves but I’ll do my best! From the moment we drove up to the property i knew we had found something special. It’s like a little dollhouse! Sooo adorable! I have never seen a place with so much love put into it, not to mention it was probably the cleanest place I’ve ever stayed. From the minute we walked in the door, we walked around and ooh’d and ahh’d for probably 20 minutes. We couldn’t believe we found something as cute as it was! The owners were so sweet and were more than happy to help us with whatever we needed. Kathy (the owner) had a bottle of wine, an amazing coffee cake that she had baked for us, along with fresh eggs, beer, water and orange juice in the refrigerator. She also had hot chocolate, hot apple cider, several creamers and coffees to choose from and even some different breakfast stuff to choose from. The kitchen was fully stocked with plenty of plates, silverware, spices, and pots and pans to cook whatever we wanted. The bed was the most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept in and had amazing sheets that made it hard to get out of ❤️. Kathy had plenty of extra blankets and pillows if you wanted them along with gorgeous thick towels for after the shower, and even some for after the hot tub that can be warmed in the towel warmer on the back porch that was amazing😍 There’s a bluetooth speaker and a little table with chairs to hang out while you cook on the grill. The wooden play scape, fire pit, corn hole boards, horse shoes, and gas grill is so perfect for families with little ones. Not to mention the two hammocks that are in the most perfect spots to hang out in. The pond right outside the front door of the cabin is adorable and my boys had a ball sleeping in a tent and getting up early to fish the next morning.
They are still talking about how much fun they had and how they didn’t want to leave. It’s truly a hidden gem. We loved it and will definitely be back! Kathy and her husband are the sweetest and truly thought of everything to make our stay so special. Thank you for everything!"

She has games and puzzles, fishing poles for catch and release, fire wood provided, ice in the freezer, orange juice, eggs and milk in the fridge and the list list goes on.

Stayed with kids","Fawn Creek is AWESOME!! We came with the kids and we all had such a great time, from relaxing in the hot tub and hammock to star gazing on the dock to petting Phoenix and roasting hot dogs in the fire. We loved lounging around the backyard playing cornhole and horseshoes. Kathy has thought of everything to make this cabin a home away from home. She even had an oscillating fan which is a must have for people like me who sleep with white noise. She personalized our names on the door and left a bottle of wine and blueberry bread which was SOOOO moist and delicious. The decor is so cute and cozy and the rainfall shower is the cherry on top. This girls trip was a blast, but I will definitely be back with just my honey for a romantic getaway 💕"

Stayed a few nights","We loved the cabin. Walking around the pasture area with Phoenix (horse) and the goats was so fun. Traditionally we aren’t hot tub people but this one is so nice that we enjoyed relaxing in it while watching the stars. The Wi-Fi is great! It even works well out by the fire pit. Kathy’s personal touches in the cabin made it extra special.
We highly recommend going in to Columbus (aprox 20 mins) and eating at Joe’s Italian -delicious Alfredo & rolls. Nancy’s Steakhouse is also good. A quick drive to the Whistling Duck Winery (about 7 mins) was fun too. I liked their Chocolate Duck wine the best. We really enjoyed getting to know Kathy & Jeff as hosts. They were available if we needed anything but otherwise let us have our privacy."

The photos do not light a candle to actually seeing this in person! Kathy and Jeff are the most hospitable hosts. They have gone way above and beyond to make our stay the best experience possible. They are so thoughtful from the animals outside to the tiniest detail inside to make our stay comfortable. They have put a lot of love into this cabin to make it a cozy and romantic and just outright enjoyable!! Cannot wait to come back and enjoy coffee on the back patio. We are definitely coming back!!

Kathy will provide you quick and easy directions to get to the cabin and she is on top of it. Cabin got everything you need!! Just bring yourself and enjoy the atmosphere.
On the plus side they have Phoenix(the greeting horse) and his entourage(fun gang of goats) to keep you companied and entertained on the other side of the fence. Lots of fish to catch and release in that pond. Bring your fishing poles!
We definitely coming back! ❤️2/22/22"

Kathy had baked us a homemade crumb cake, had rose petals strewn over the bed, with wine and chocolate covered strawberries. The entire place is so surreal!

She had a chalkboard on the door with our names and even gave us a bottle of wine and a coffee cake. Her cabin is extremely well decorated and you can tell they put a lot of money and care into building it. Our favorite part was the sweet horse, Phoenix, and the goats. She let us give them treats and we loved getting to pet them. Kathy was a great host and her communication was fantastic. If you’re considering booking, do it, you won’t regret it!! It’s truly such a peaceful place and we hope to visit again in the future."

Stayed with kids","We really loved this place and couldn’t ask for better hosts. Kathy is thoughtful, detailed oriented, and nothing was spared. This place is so well designed , built, & tastefully decorated . While it is cozy in size , the host managed to build and include amenities most modern houses usually wouldn’t have . It is perfect for a romantic secluded getaway or for a small family . We really liked the setting with the pond right outside and being surrounded by nature. Our 4 yo really enjoyed fishing in the pond, giving Phoenix the horse treats, and the experience at Hatari wildlife park a few miles away . While my wife & I enjoyed soaking in the hot tub , and star gazing by the pond. I wouldn’t be doing the review justice if I didn’t mention the bed. If you haven’t slept on a super comfortable “sleep number” bed then you’re in for a treat.
All in all we had a great experience and highly recommend visiting the cabin at Fawn creek."

Stayed a few nights","This is the perfect spot for an escape from the city. The attention to detail in the cabin and grounds is superb. The trim and finishes are beautiful and the land is gorgeous. The cabin is cozy, perfect for a couple. Three or four people might be ok (there's a pull out bed in the couch apparently) but it would be tight for 4 if it's raining or too hot to utilize the outdoor space. Kathy & Jeff live in their home on the 20 acre property but you will have your own slice of the property in back with an amazing view of the land. The patio is so well thought out with an outdoor table, an air chair, a hammock, hot tub, a great fire-pit, twinkle lighting and more. Do not miss your opportunity to visit with Phoenix the horse and the goats; they were all so very friendly and so fun to pet and interact with. Watch at dawn and dusk for deer. Be aware, both of our mobile phones (on two separate service networks) had no connection in this remote location, but the cabin's good wi-fi made up for that. Perfect location for a long weekend escape from Austin, Houston or San Antonio. We brought our mountain bikes and spent one day riding at Rocky Hill Ranch and Bluff Creek Ranch. It's a bit of a drive to get to the ranches, but worth it, and you can always grab some pie at Royer's in Round Top while you're in the area. I would absolutely stay here again."

We had not water that night or the next morning. It couldn't be foreseen, and it did work when we got there, but it was too late when it went out to fix it. The next day, Mark came down and had a repairman replace the pump. I appreciate the way he quickly responded to the problem and took care of it.
The property is nice and secluded, surrounded with trees. It was relaxing sitting out on the covered deck watching the birds fly around and the river flow by. Very quiet neighborhood."

The only things that bothered my wife and I was the cleanliness. Two of the few utensils they had were noticeably dirty. There was a layer of grease on the spatula and tongs, so we didn't feel confident using those. The fridge and freezer also could use a deep clean.
They have an outdoor dog, Buddy, who is SO FRIENDLY! He was my 18 month old daughter's favorite part about the stay! His barking throughout the night time is fairly loud...kept us awake for a bit the first night...BUT was a great protector!
I was happy with the stay overall, but I marked this as a 4 star because of the cleanliness I mentioned above. Again, Sarah was wonderful!"

Stayed a few nights","Not much to say. Location is out of the way for most amenities but is the reason I chose Sarah’s place. I wanted something secluded and quiet away from the highway. Pretty much had the run of the place.
Room was very small but I was in the area for work. My day consisted of being up at 5:00am and back to the room by 6:00, shower, answering emails and to bed, rinse and repeat. So I did not need much more than a place to sleep. There were options for me to relax and watch TV in the common room, outside or on the hammocks. There was a lake / pond but I did not visit.
I thoroughly enjoyed being there and will return on my return trip."

Stayed a few nights",The place was beautifully appointed. There was no kitchen but they did provide an electric frypan and toaster. The only problem was I did not pay enough attention to the picture of the bedroom. The bed was wall to wall and you had to crawl up into the bed. At 80 years old that was not doable if you have had knee replacement surgery and back problems.

Stayed one night","This was our first ever AirBnB experience! we've always stayed in hotels upto now.
We're from the England and we are on a 2 week trip around Texas & New Orleans.
This place is amazing, right off the beaten track on a small ranch where you can wonder about with the heard of cattle, the donkey & a pony. A seat by the pond is perfect, watching the wildlife. Or you can chill in the hammocks or the swing seats. Buster the dog will be your companion throughout your stay, he is the most welcoming & friendly Labrador. He enjoys a piece of toast at breakfast, but he's very wellntrained and doesn't jump up or beg for food and he stays on guard all night outside of your accommodation. The banquet hall is just amazing, filled with character. The bedroom was lively and had the most comfortable bed in it. Both bathrooms were very clean and there was shampoo, conditioner and body wash provided. Coffee & tea making facilities, microwave & fridge freezer were also available to use roo."

My son is autistic and an animal lover. The minute we pulled up, buddy their dog became his best friend. Didn’t leave his side the whole trip. Requested the fire pit for night time s’mores, they had it ready to go for us at sunset. Got some fishing in, and plenty of time on the hammock pavilion with a book. Will be back again when we need some quiet time. Highly recommend Rosarita Ranch!"

Stayed a few nights",It was dark when I arrived and I was nervous driving on the detoured country road 4 miles to find their place (construction underway of bridge ). But Sarah’s husband greeted me at the gate along with adorable puppy dog Buddy. Helping me get settled in made for a warm welcome. I didn’t realize how hot and humid TX could get in March ! so Sarah allowed me to keep the A/C on during the day to avoid another migraine which I got the first night. The location is a bit remote but then again so was my Spartan race ! :) The little House I stayed in was adorable - well renovated and decorated and private. It will be a shock to go home and share space again ! I highly recommend this place and Sarah’s gang!

Both Sarah and Roberto were very welcoming and helpful during our stay. After a long day, they recommended eating at Lupe's (which was delicious). Once we arrived back on the ranch, we enjoyed the night in the hammocks. The area was very relaxing and very spacious! The bed was super comfortable, we fell asleep as soon as our heads hit the pillows. Once we woke up, they cooked an amazingly delicious breakfast. This was a perfect weekend getaway and we will definitely be back in the future! 💕"

The property is secluded and quiet and we thoroughly enjoyed exploring it and feeding the donkey after we ate our own delicious breakfast which was included in our stay. When we first send out to feed the donkey and her friends, they were down at the wood line and we were unable to see them. Roberto was nice and came out to call them up for us. It was a fun experience. Recommend for the area!"

We walked by the river & saw beautiful fields of yellow flowers and the land was plush and green with many trees. There was livestock and other beautiful animals to smile at.

As birdwatchers we were especially pleased with being able to bird the extensive wooded areas of the property (3 species of Owl heard!) What a great way to experience rural Texas in the wintertime. Grateful to our hosts for the stay and special thanks to Roberto for the lovely conversations, we learned a lot and hope to be back someday! Highly recommend this Airbnb to all travelers.

We even got to choose the time it was served (we are not early risers). After breakfast we enjoyed a walk around the property where we were delighted by funny chickens and an adorable donkey. Breathing in fresh country air, we sat by the pond and watched the cows as they watched us lol. We would highly recommend the Rosarita Ranch to anyone wanting a quiet getaway with friendly hosts and a delicious breakfast."

The vibes of this place are all loving and happy, just immediately puts your mind at ease and leaves you in a peaceful and relaxing mood. It’s a great way to connect with nature and spend time with family. Mr. Robert welcomed us immediately on his tractor and suggested all the things we could do. We had so much fun exploring, walking out in the woods, and observing the animals grazing the land. Our 2 year old son had a blast feeding the cows, pony, donkey, chasing chickens, and catching frogs! Can’t forget to mention their dog, Buddy! He is the sweetest dog ever and very well behaved. We popped off some fireworks for 4th of July and Buddy even tried to put out the fire thinking we were in danger ;) The food recommended by Sarah and Robert was amazing, especially Lupe’s. The banquet hall we stayed was perfect and had everything we needed for a cozy stay. This was the perfect getaway from city life and a great experience for our little one. I didn’t want to leave and I would love to return soon!!! Thank you to the gracious hosts, Sarah and Robert for sharing this with us!"

Stayed one night","This is a peaceful place to stay. It is a room/event space on a ranch in East Bernard, TX. There are many chickens and cows on the property that you can see (the roosters may even wake you up bright and early!). The property also has hammocks, a fire pit, and a pond. Definitely a ""farm- life"" getaway from the city. We stayed here overnight because we were attending a wedding in Wharton, TX. The wedding venue was about 25 minutes away from this AirBnB. I will say that this part of Texas is pretty rural. Be sure to pack food (snacks) and water for your trip as well as cold weather clothing, thicker socks, hiking shoes or boots, and flashlights. There is not much close by (restraunts, stores, etc.). The exception is a Bucc-ee's about 12 minutes away from the Air BnB. This is your best source of supplies if you need something during your trip. Cellphone data coverage may be limited on the property, but wifi is included in the room. The room includes a refrigerator and microwave for food storage and preperation. A coffee machine and coffee are provided in the room. Robert and Sarah are very accommodating. Robert even helped us start a fire after a rain storm and offered us a bottle of wine to help relax. Very nice customer service! They have a dog named Buddy who is the sweetest thing. You can play with him as much as you like! Overall a great stay. Escape the city and unwind in the country!"

Stayed a few nights","Roberto and Sarah were very warm, welcoming and very accommodating. It is way out yonder as was in the listing, which is what my friend and I were looking for. Although they had lots of animals, it was very clean. Sarah provided a delicious breakfast each morning and was kind enough to customize it to each of our preferences and the time we wanted it. They also brought out firewood and got the firepit going and turned on the lights around the firepit. We really enjoyed sitting out on the clear night and enjoying the fire. They have hammocks and make the area very inviting. It is truly out in the country, so if you are squeamish about mice, you may not want to book the big ""conference"" room. There was evidence in the bathroom of one and then when I went in there, there was one. He/she quickly cleared out upon sight of me... LOL! It is spacious, but the bathrooms and refrigerator are at the total opposite end of where the bedroom is and where the table with microwave and coffee are set up. The only other thing was that the breaker kept tripping. The first time was around midnight the first night, so we had to go knock on their door to find out where the breaker box was, etc. It happened at least one more time that night and two or three times the next night. That was a little frustrating that we would have to go out in the cold and flip the breaker. You may want to confirm that the breaker situation has been resolved if you are booking the big conference room. All in all, the place was relaxing."

Stayed a few nights","This was my first experience with Airbnb, and I have to say that it was a wonderful, eye-opener. I decided to go visit my family in Wharton, TX and was looking for a place to stay. I have always been a hotel guy, but my girlfriend convinced me to try Airbnb. That's where we found Rosarita Ranch. Rosarita Ranch is quite literally in the middle of nowhere, and I would not have had it any other way. A series of country roads will get you to the front gate, which is where Sarah first met me and my girlfriend, Gail. She took us on a tour of the place and we instantly felt welcomed. The ranch is home to a menagerie of critters, from donkeys to chickens to Buddy the dog, and a few others I did not get to see. Everyday we were provided breakfast by Sarah and Robert, which ranged from homemade omelets to waffles to fruit and oatmeal. Robert is a very interesting man who spends his time hunting and practicing taxidermy. Throughout the day as we were moving around, we'd see him conducting his daily routine and he would always wave hello. Overall, it was a tremendously awesome experience which I would highly recommend if you are ever down the East Bernard way."

There's a nice little studio apartment (bedroom/sitting area plus bathroom), a connected narrow area with another half-dozen bunks, then the kitchen is down steep stairs from the bunk area. This would be an ideal spot for a group of young folks or an extended family. We didn't meet the hosts, who were out of town, but were delighted with the fresh eggs left for us to make for breakfast."

Overall, I wouldn't consider it rural and there was a bit more road noise than I would have liked, but it's a nice spot and it's well worth the price. I would recommend it to anyone that isn't necessarily looking for a long getaway and just wants something nicer than a hotel."

Tons of games and diversions are available both indoors & outdoors.
Note: this cabin is fairly remote. You will need to travel 35 minutes to reach the nearest convenience store & 45 minutes to the nearest restaurant. If you want to ‘get away’, this place is perfect."

Stayed a few nights","If you are looking for a place to relax that makes you feel you are far away and yet, comfortably at home, this is the perfect place for you. We enjoyed everything during the day. However, we could not enjoy making smores by the fire pit at night because it is just too dark; more lighting by the pond would help. We booked this placed mainly so my 21-year-old son could fish; the pond looked a bit bigger in the pictures. He was somewhat disappointed that there were few and little fish in it. Sussane had communicated the pond had been stocked with blue catfish about a year ago and that the fish may still be small. However, per my son's experience, the fish should have been bigger by now if they were stocked a year ago.
Being that the closest store is about 30 mins away, I was concerned at first about needing something for cooking or anything to keep us entertained, but the house has everything you need, and I mean ""everything""."

We specifically enjoyed the peace and quiet of being out in the country. The stars at night were certainly big and bright over this Texas Hideaway. This was the perfect spot for us and our dogs to relax while being close to my wife's father. I have nothing but great things to say about our entire experience. Suzanne, thank you so much."

Communication with Suzanne was perfect (and prompt) from the start and throughout our stay. The home is very comfortable and the grounds are amazing for the dog. There are great spots to bask in the sun and others to rest in the shade, as we often did. As mentioned in the description about the hideaway, the star gazing is absolutely spectacular. We sat on the deck upstairs every night looking up at the sky and relaxing only begins to describe those moments.
We can't wait to visit this secluded gem again!"

The home is decorated with a cute country style with lots of custom wood and a stone fireplace. The home has more amenities than we could have even dreamed... indoor and outdoor games, great kitchen appliances for every occasion, and even bicycles to ride around the property.

It’s two bedroom, one bath and is exceptionally comfortable. Individual AC control rooms kept the house wonderfully cool. We watched lots of fishing YouTube videos on the big screen TV. Cell service is not the best in Markham but Wi-Fi at the house kept us in contact with Home. We really enjoyed our stay and Susan added a very nice touch with homemade baked cookies upon our arrival. We’re looking forward to our next stay there!"

We were there for a wedding and bragged to all the other guests about the Cowboy Bunkhouse (they were at a hotel nearby and they I know every single one of them was jealous). Thank you so much Susan for making us feel right at home. Can’t wait to come back for another visit!

I shoved at least three in my mouth before I remembered I usually don’t eat c.c. Cookies. The house is beautifully decorated with very rustic farm decor and big on charm. This two bed room one bath fit our needs perfectly for our two dogs and us. The six min. drive into town was close enough to get all or provisions yet, the right distance to get way from it all. Here you can unplug kick back an enjoy the one you are with. Markham offers several places to eat an get all three meals of the day also a 24 hour gas station around the corner for any last minute items for the home or car. The owners are very hands off to provide all the privacy you need and were readily available to address any issues you might have. They offered us first hand knowledge on the area which was very helpful in making our decision for areas of places to reside. The two months in the Bunkhouse made for a comfortable, quiet, an pleasant stay. You will not be disappointed with this Airbnb. I give this place six stars on a scale of 1-5. Lisa and Joaquin G."

She communicated with us on travel day to make sure everything was ready for us on arrival. The only issue that Carol and I had was, we believe in Texas sized coffee cups. So if you like big coffee cups, might bring your own. If time takes us back to the area we would like to stay there again."

This was my first Airbnb experience and I am super impressed! Susan went out of her way to make sure our needs were met and even left homemade cookies upon arrival. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. My dad and I enjoyed our relaxing weekend with a short commute to the games.

Stayed with kids","The place this Airbnb is at was beautiful. The house was cozy, family centered. the amenities were great, the place had everything you needed... even children's toys in the kids room. It was a very well thought out place.
The water at the place is very saline so they had a water cooler with a couple multi-gallon bottles of drinking water to use for drinking/cooking etc available.
There were a couple cats on the patio outside the master bedroom, and their kibble in the room to feed every day, which were a pleasant surprise for us. the neighbor's German shepherd roamed free and came to greet us in the mornings, and when we pulled into the place in the evenings, also a welcome surprise for us.
I will say the place is much smaller than it looks in the pictures, otherwise the descriptions and amenities etc were accurate. The main house was a perfect size for our party of 7, we did not really use the in-law suite type separate room across the porch much at all."

The house provided ample porch space and lighting at night. The only suggestion I have would be to spray the trees for the worms.

Very accommodating and quick to respond with any questions. I left my toiletry bag/makeup bad and she was very quick to let me know and offered to ship it to me. I would stay again and recommend it 100%
If going for splashway and want out of the crowd and some privacy it’s right down the road with easy access."

Pleased with the perpetual hot water, the abundance of snacks and all the condiments, coffee and fixings furnished to meet our daily needs for prepping our meals. We slept warm and comfortable in this nicely furnished duplex. We enjoyed the books to read as well as the huge TV to watch. It was fabulously clean, a quiet & safe neighborhood close to Sheridan and right off the highway made it easy to find. Simple check in and out. We would gladly stay here when we are in this area of Texas again."

The home was clean, and the little touches like the Scentsy and instructions for everything in the home were awesome. The setup was amazing, and the toiletries and snacks being available to us were a plus. Definitely recommend this little place. Unit B has a driveway, but Unit A does not, so I was little uncomfortable with my vehicle being so near the road. Overall, AMAZING!"

Saved me a trip to Walmart as soon as i got there because there were toiletries and snacks waiting for us! The beds and pillows were very comfortable and everything was well maintained and clean. The only thing i can say is that the home is more Sheridan than Hallettsville but that worked out well for us. It’s so close to Splashway, which is great for kids! I would stay here every time we come visit our family. It’s a sweet little home away from home."

Stayed one night","OMG!!! This is a ""STOP"" & ""MUST"" Read Review about this Airbnb! Where do I start? First of all, writing reviews is not my thing but after our stay I just had to take the time to write this. I was hesitant about going cuz I figured, what's out in Hallettsville, TX ya know? But my mom wanted to have a girl's weekend, so I gave in. When we arrived at the location I thought, WOW would ya just look at this! Immediately could not wait to go inside & check it out! As I open the door, I am in such aww of what I seen, smelt, & felt! This place was immaculate, I mean beyond gorgeous. Every little detail was thought of all the way down to the temperature being oh so perfect inside. I go to open the refrigerator & so many refreshments/snacks were just chilling, ready for the picking. It was so updated w/everything Bluetooth. We slept like babies & played like kids at the waterpark that is literally within walking distance. The food was amazing & to be honest we will rebook this again very soon!!!"

Stayed with kids",The host was great. She left little buckets of treats around the home for us to use. She had cold water ready for us when we arrived. She was very nice and attentive to us and our needs. She also let us use the homes water hose so we could use a slip and slide. The house is in the backyard of the main home. There is no central air however each room has a window AC unit. The back room the AC is blocked by the beds headboard so it can get hot in the room. There were not enough cooking/kitchen supplies. There is a nice large washer and dry that they provided the supplies to use. The wifi is a little spotty. The “extra” bed or couch was a futon that you are able to lower the back of. The town is small had a few restaurants and has a H‑E‑B which was very good. It was only 1 hour away from the beach which was a extra bonus.

Stayed a few nights","I had to change the time of my check in twice on the day of and Valerie was very understanding. The weather in southeast Texas is a bit like equatorial New Guinea at the moment and “hot and humid” just doesn’t quite describe the conditions. After my first night, I arrived back from work and asked Valerie about additional air conditioning. Before I knew it, she was off to find a fan that would blow out a bouncy house and a larger window unit….all at 6 o’clock in the evening. The fan was delivered in minutes and the existing AC was being modded to try and keep up for another night.
The following day, I arrived back to find that if I wanted, I could have made snow with a new unit that had been installed in my absence.
I cannot overstate the service and attentiveness paid by Valerie and her staff making me feel at home. The little place is situated behind her stately historic home and visitors can drive right up to the front door of your stay. Quiet and peaceful place! Thank you Val"

We were given a tour and then welcomed to fish (which we did ) ! The pictures featured do not do justice to the beauty of the property. There was cable and wifi , cool air , and a working fridge - country life at its best with petting the cattle . Gated in made us feel safe and the quiet nights made for perfect sleep . It was a wonderful experience that I highly recommend you take ! Worth every penny and we do plan on staying again ! Lachelle is a fantastic hosts and we are beyond pleased with her service ! Good people who made us feel like family ."

There were horses, turkeys, chickens, dogs out and about on the property, which was fun to experience (although if you have a dog that doesn’t do well with other animals, they may face issues).
The kitchen has plenty of utensils and dish ware, but I’d recommend bringing a few of your own items from home if you plan on cooking (I.e. a sharp knife, cutting board, oil).
The hosts were super helpful and responsive!"

I asked if we could have a late check out Incase I needed to come back and let the baby take a nap and she graciously extended our check out to 7 pm. AMAZING! The place was clean & spacious. We had everything we needed. The beds were very comfortable & there were plenty of them. The property is beautiful and very well kept. Sweet animals and lots of wildlife. I loved that it was gated and didn’t have to worry about anyone messing with our vehicles or belongings. Very affordable and definitely worth it. We will be returning.

Stayed one night","Tans cabin was a really cool place. Feels like an authentic hunting or cabin in the woods, but with a touch of all modern amenities. It was very spacious and cozy. We had a great time and when I’m back in the area. I will be choosing Tans cabin."

Stayed one night",This was a very nice house to stay in although admittedly it took us a while to find the house. The shell driveway was very bumpy and a little inconvenient. Overall this house was very nice and clean! We had a great time and only 30 minutes from the beach!

Stayed a few nights",Loved finding this place and staying here instead of a hotel! It was super cute and cozy and fit our family of 4 perfectly. Loved having a nice kitchen so we didn’t have to eat out every day if we didn’t want to and laundry is super convenient too! It was the perfect place to relax at the end of the day and the neighborhood is quiet. We will definitely stay here again next time we are in Bay. City!! Thank you so much for offering your home!! 🧡

Stayed one night","This was a great find!!! The home seems to be decorated by Joanna Gaines! If I had an AirBnB, I would definitely decorate the same way. After 2 days of driving 1500 miles from far southern California, I was extremely tired, this home felt like home! Fell fast asleep. It was clean, had everything, and was conveniently located to town.
Heidi was super responsive and no issues with self entry or self checkout.
If you are wanting a very nice, clean and extremely comfortable home to stay, THIS IS IT!"

Stayed with a pet",This house was in an excellent location for our hunting trip! We enjoyed our stay there. The home was very comfortable. We were able to get in and out easily with the coded lock. We were close to some area of town that had restaurants and gas stations! The house was adorable on the inside and had very comfortable beds!

Stayed with kids",Heidi's place was perfect for our intimate Christmas family gathering. We had plenty of space to make a holiday dinner and spend quality time with my grandma and mother-in-law. This was SO much better than meeting at a restaurant and I am very grateful to Heidi for allowing us in her home.
