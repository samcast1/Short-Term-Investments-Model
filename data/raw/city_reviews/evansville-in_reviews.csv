Stayed a few nights","Overall, we were very pleased to stay here. We loved the look of this place—very nicely decorated. We also loved being able to walk to eateries. The pillows were very comfortable, but the mattress was on the firm side for us. Plus the bed is a bit tall; a short adult might find it awkward to get into. We thought the internet connection was kind of slow in some areas. Also the water pressure was low. But even with those down sides, we would stay here again."

The bed was so comfortable and she even left us some snacks! Kelly’s place is in walking distance to some amazing restaurants and bars and she has some fantastic recommendations in her guide book that we really appreciated! We loved Mo’s House for cocktails and great atmosphere, Schymiks for Sunday brunch, and Bokeh lounge for live music and Sunday night Karaoke. We went to a show at The Victory Theatre which was just a few blocks away and was the perfect location for an intimate concert. Evansville really hit all the marks, the hospitality is like no where else we’ve been and Kelly’s place was the cherry on top!"

The neighborhood is gorgeous. The tree-lined, brick street is full of beautiful Victorian homes and it’s a close walk to coffee shops, restaurants, and the riverfront. I hated to leave!"

The house looks much bigger than the photos due to the incredibly high ceilings throughout. We took a short walk to parlor doughnuts where we had an amazing breakfast and even took some delicious doughnuts home with us! The value for what you get at Kelly’s place is unbeatable. I wouldn’t hesitate to book again!

The home is beautiful with gorgeous historic homes around it on a brick street walkable to multiple restaurants, the river, and more. The furniture is comfortable and the home is tastefully decorated. Everything is very well thought out to make the guests feel at home with extra amenities. The owner went above and beyond to carry up my doordash delivery to our place when it arrived minutes before we did. I will be a repeat guest when I visit family in Evansville."

Stayed a few nights","Kelly's home is absolutely charming: spacious, quiet and very clean. The location is excellent, within walking distance of both the river and the restaurants and shops of Main Street.
It also boasts perhaps the best stock on amenities I've encountered, such as coffee creamer in the fridge, an excellent selection of loose-leaf tea and a bathroom stocked with (among many other things) lotion and facial cleanser. It was lovely to find on hand all the things that one wants to bring but might not make it into a carry-on.
Kelly was wonderful to work with - friendly, responsive and very accommodating.
Should I find myself looking for an Airbnb in the area again, I shall certainly check first to see if this one is available!"

You will be right in the center of where you want to be - close to the river, the downtown scene, and the city’s best restaurants. And when you are “home”, you’ll enjoy every inch of the sunny, beautifully decorated apartment upstairs. A great comfy bedroom with washer and dryer, laid back, cozy living room, and full kitchen with a great gathering table for meals, games, and hanging out. Their library provides fun reading about Evansville and the Civil War - my husband spent most evenings in the big recliner with books in his lap.
And…it was all so easy with Kelly! A marvelous host indeed…"

The street it is on is gorgeous, very quiet, lined with historic homes on large lots. It seems to be in a great location for restaurants and other activities, although we used it as a ""home base"" so didn't do much other than walk to Penny Lane coffeehouse around the corner (highly recommend). Our whole stay was perfect and we'll be back. You will LOVE this apartment. It's far more spacious and charming than even the beautiful photos can convey."

I loved the recommendations left and we found some really neat places thanks to that! Several places are walkable...a great thing since many streets were under construction. The doors took a little figuring out (shutting and locking) but we figured it out and tried to stay quiet in doing so. Would have liked a bit more outdoor space (the front porch felt like we were being intrusive) but the inside was comfortable enough we didn't mind drinking our wine indoors. Overall A+ accomodations!

We did try two of the recommended restaurants this time, the coffee shop and Sauced, and both were fabulous. Very quiet, but within walking distance to many restaurants and bars. It is really an area that is conducive to walking, which is unusual and very nice."

The home was so relaxing and modern (well decorated). The beds and furniture was comfortable. The jacuzzi was a plus but we did not get a chance to use it. The rooftop provided a wonderful view, especially at night. Parking provided was so convenient for our guest. We felt totally safe and Nathan was a very good communicator.

The area is very quiet during day and night time which is an invitation to relax. You are 3 blocks away from Main St with a few great food options and in the heart of downtown Evansville, the children museum and a hospital. The apartment is super confortable. Has about everything you need to do anything. They even included tons of toys for our toddler to play. Amazing hosts in a great great confortable apartment. The roof deck is simply beautiful and has a great view of the historic district of the city. Host is very personable, instructions are clear and easy. The covered garage for us was amazing to have as its facilitates the load and unload with pets and babies. Would visit again 100%."

The place was very spacious, beautiful, and you feel right at home with all they have to offer. I arrived earlier than the rest of the group to decorate and as a female I felt very safe with the parking situation, getting inside, and spending the first bit of time here alone. Of course, I locked every door behind me, so be mindful that anything could happen anywhere, but in general I did feel very safe! 10/10 recommend if you’re looking to stay in a great location, close to restaurants and not too far of a drive to other places, and it is reasonably priced especially considering the amount of people it can sleep comfortably!"

I had no idea when I booked Nathan’s place just how wonderful it truly was! My kids were amazed from the retro vintage look to the jetted tub then the roof top room everything was just a dream! We had my daughters birthday there the last night of our stay and she told me she had wished that could be our forever home when she blew her candles out! It was Deff sad to leave because it was more then just our home away from home it was better! Also if you stay here you don’t have to worry about if you forgot anything they have it fully stocked for you! I was so satisfied and would do it again in a heartbeat!!

Stayed with a pet","Fantastic location downtown where it's easy to get to everything but off the main busy streets, so easy traffic and parking. The rental is spotless -- immaculately clean. It was perfect for what we needed for a few days. Three bathrooms, a huge kitchen and island, and big living room area for sitting and chatting. Check in was easy after you download the app. Great hosts with availability for help and clear, easy communication on the place. Would definitely recommend if you have four adults and two kids (for the bunks). Also pet friendly so we were able to have our dogs with us. Definitely a roomy, stylish, clean place for a big group. Would stay again even without a big group!"

Although I had no need for it, Nathan has a space for kids, games and plenty of space to entertain the kids. Cooking breakfast was a breeze, the kitchen was equipped with everything you need to cook a meal, literally... everything! Very quiet neighborhood and low traffic area over the weekend, not sure what weekday traffic looks like. Everything from the couch to the bed was super comfortable. If you pass on the opportunity to stay in this place, you will be missing out on something truly wonderful."

Overall the place was dusty and dirty, especially around the floorboards. There were ants in the kitchen. In the bathroom, we had one giant industrial-sized container of Softsoap instead of an actual soap dispenser. The walls are pretty bare (except for the walls in the photos). Overall, this Airbnb met our needs of having a place to sleep and spread out. It just lacked those details that make a welcoming cozy five-star experience."

Stayed one night","This property has easy access, clean, new appliances, and a huge bed with a memory foam mattress.
That said, the accommodations suggest this tiny duplex sleeps 4. This is 100% NOT true.
We traveled for 11 hours to get to Evansville only to find out that this AirBNB was only set up for 2 people, even though I made it clear in my reservation/communication that there would be 3 adults.
My grown son had to sleep on a couch (not a pullout) with his feet hanging off the end. There was NO extra bedding available. Luckily, I brought a pillow/blanket for the trip.
NOTE: 2 glasses, 2 cups, 2 towels, 2 washcloths, etc. reinforced that this was NOT a place for 4.
Since the ad is inaccurate, this property may or may not be worth the price."

Just 2 minor suggestions: Place an easier to read number on the front of the house. It was dusk when I arrived and a little hard to tell. Second, make some improvements to front yard. It's perfectly fine, but property would show a lot better with improvements, especially because next door neighbors have done, and so it would be consistent. These are small things, virtually no impact for me. Everything else was outstanding and highly recommend. Also restaurants short drive away, and UE is walkable if that's what brings you to Evansville. Thanks!"

It is a comfortable, pleasant single room with private bath and a large closet with a suitcase stand and hooks for coats and clothes. There is also a convenient counter with sink and mini fridge and coffeemaker. Everything is sparkling clean. The bed is very comfortable. A favorite thing for me is the beautifully landscaped yard surrounding this very attractive older brick house in which this accommodation is nestled on the second floor . . . up a moderately long staircase (which to my mind adds to its charm)."

John met us at the property that was easy to find, he communicated with us a couple times just to be sure we found our event venue and ask if we needed anything so great communication, easy to park on street, perfect accomodations for my husband and I, comfortable bed and furnishings. Will for sure stay again and let our friends/family know it's a great place to stay in Evansville!"

A lot of the houses have been renovated/updated and/or are in the process of updating. Coffee shop just a block from the place. Easy walk to the Ford Center, restaurants, etc. Jon's place is a simple one bedroom w/ bathroom. It was perfect for me! Microwave/coffeemaker (w/ coffee) included. Room has it's own AC window unit to cool the room off if needed.
I will definitely stay at Jon's place again if it's available the next time I visit Evansville.

If you are coming during the cold season, as I did, do bring 1 or 2 space heaters(if possible), and/or extra blankets. Me and my partner found that it can get very cold at night. Other than that, I don’t have any other concerns/complaints and I hope you guys enjoy your stay."

Stayed one night","It was a perfect place to stay, cozy and very clean and the location was perfect, we just wished we had stayed for at least the weekend. So many neat places within walking distance. Walton’s smoke house for dinner, Mo’s place for drinks, A unique bar/lounge and breakfast at (Penny lane coffee house) the next day made for a great visit. Jon met us there, was very friendly and communication was great. Wished for more time, so we could have walked around in the daytime to see all the beautiful old houses and have lunch at the table outside, the landscaping is beautiful."

We loved the hot tub, pool, and sauna! The ratio of rooms to bathrooms was fantastic and the fact they were connected was very nice at night time so we didn't wake everyone else when our kids were fussing/needed to use the bathroom. Having some drinks available and waiting for us when we arrived was a very thoughtful touch as well! The working Roku systems throughout the house, the outdoor areas, and the expanded parking were all phenomenal aspects given the size of our group and our varying entertainment needs. Our 2 yr old loved being able to climb up and down all the stairs and play hide and seek with his uncle's and aunts. And lastly, the house itself was just beautiful. 10/10 would stay again."

The house itself has a unique charm to it, and makes you feel right at ease. Of course, I could talk about house great having an indoor and outdoor pool was, as well as a sauna and hot tub. But I think that the beds were all comfortable, that the bathrooms were completely clean and my party was surprisingly overwhelming by his hospitality.
Kind Regards,

Stayed a few nights","There’s not many places that offer the amenities this home offers. Beautiful historic home with unique qualities of yesteryear. The furniture is very comfortable—especially the beds. The icing on the cake, is the indoor heated lap pool. We also loved the hot tub. If that’s not enough, there’s a sauna though we didn’t use that. It’s very unusual to have this size grounds for a downtown house. It looks like it would be wonderful to use the outdoor pool and lounge area if we visited in the summer. It’s the perfect place for a mini-staycation or just to enjoy downtown Evansville while staying in a beautiful home."

Stayed about a week","David is everything you would expect from a top-notch AirBNB host! He was super responsive throughout our stay and the home felt extremely welcoming and had everything we could possibly need for the week.
The home was stocked with treats, including bread and eggs and orange juice and thoughtful snacks, plenty of towels for the pool -- all the amenities and some I never expected!
The home was a lovely older home in a quiet neighborhood but only 10 mins from several fun activities. It's extremely private so you can be comfortable roaming the space at will.
My partner, my two girls and their friends each had our own bedroom and private space to hang out and could come together in the kitchen or pool area to play. It was PERFECT for six people / three couples/sets of people.
10/10, highly recommend both the home and the relationship with the host!! Thanks so much, David."

Stayed with a pet","The house was as depicted in the photos so there was no complaint there. Unfortunately the house is on a busy street and also backs on a highway. The traffic was loud and relentless until later in the evening when it tapered off but still any vehicles that did go by, dogs that barked, sirens or motorcycles, were very loud. Around 4am the traffic picked up again. We checked the windows to see if they were properly closed because the noise was so loud. They were but just dont provide the insulation needed for such a high traffic area.. My husband enjoyed the lap pool but the dry sauna wasnt working but the host did come over and got it working. Would not go back because of the noise otherwise everything was fine."

The remodeling and updating of things are done very well. I really enjoyed the modern well-stocked kitchen. Great space to feed a large group. The beds were soft and we all had great rooms to stay in. The dining room table was long enough so that our group could all set together. The family room was a great space for conversations. I really enjoyed the indoor lap pool. That was a big hit with our group. The porch off of the pool house was great for evening meals and conversations. There is an outdoor pool as well as a covered patio next to it. We would stay again and again and again.

I had mentioned we were celebrating my birthday and we were surprised to see both a birthday cake and a birthday card waiting for me upon arrival. David also had some start-up groceries all set for us in the kitchen--eggs, bread, fruit, chips and snacks, candy, soda, water, condiments. We really appreciated his thoughtfulness as we had just driven 8 hours to get to his home.
The bedding and pillows were luxurious and he had thought of everything you could possibly need for amenities in the bathroom. This place is incredible as it is and I know that he is working hard to continuously improve it."

Stayed one night","Jessica's place is AMAZING! You can see the river from the bed-which is one of the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in! The decor is bright, clean and comfortable. Perfect place for a short stay - there is a sweet kitchenette. They own the coffee shop below and provide you with a free drip coffee each day you stay - because of this there is no coffee pot, which is fine for light coffee drinkers, however, my husband drinks a pot of coffee everyday so this would not be feasible for an extended stay. He needed more coffee and we needed breakfast so we went down to coffee shop and had more coffee and breakfast, we sat outside on the covered deck and it was absolutely lovely!
We walked the lit up river in the evening, which is right outside the apartment.
It is above the coffee shop, but the noise was not bad at all and my husband is really sensitive to noise.
We absolutely loved it there! Comfortable, beautiful, relaxing... Exactly what we needed!
Thanks Jessica! ☺️"

She has the perfect setting (ideal for tranquility, walking through the downtown area and a gorgeous view), impeccable design that flows well in the space with well-appointed amenities and convenience of being above one of their 4 HoneyMoon coffeehouses with access to amazing coffee and food. I live locally, but was having a plumbing problem and needed to be out of my home for a couple of days. Jessica made sure the room was ready early so I could check in before the standard 4pm. So easy to communicate with her with very prompt responses and the easiest check-out I’ve ever experienced in any market I’ve stayed. Had an amazing stay and I have to say, I wouldn’t expect anything less from small business owners whose coffeehouses are known for the quality of their coffee and food, zen-like atmospheres and above all, the people they hire to work in them. This quality is apparent in all they do."

Getting there my expectations were blown out the water with such a clean and cute place. The bed is nice and the AC is amazing. The showers are the best, and I was glad to share it with my partner with the dual shower heads. I will say I had a concern with being over top a cafe but once I visited the cafe and stayed a few nights there was little to no noise and was greatly appreciated. I highly recommend this stay for anyone who is staying within the area, not to mention the amazing coffee, breakfast and ice cream downstairs."

On looking at the pics of the place and descriptions i was interested. Now that I stayed it will be my go to as long as its not already booked. Very easy to book. Accommodated a 1 night stay. Had all the amenities and the area is very peaceful river front. The front deck overlooks the river for an amazing sunset and mornings boast a magnificent glow as the sun rises. The front porch has just enough room to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee and catch up on communications and be relaxed while doing it. Perfect for a couple or single travelers. Washer and dryer, small kitchenette, fridge etc. didn’t get to use all that but its there. Great area for a morning or eve walk also. Highly Recommend!"

It did not disappoint, and the shampoo/conditioner, body wash and even towels smelt amazing! The bed was so comfortable, made for such a good nights sleep! You will wake up to the smell of the coffee brewing downstairs, it was a bit noisy too but it didn’t bother us. Loved the location and being in walking distance to so many cute places to eat and shop. The balcony overlooking the river is pretty small and quite a few bugs were hanging out at night but the view from inside was just as pretty so we hung out in there instead. We weren’t able to get the ceiling fan to work but the room still stayed pretty cool without it! Jessica was a great Host, I could tell she genuinely wanted us to have a great stay. Definitely recommend this place to stay at with your honey (see what I did there 😏)! We will be back again for sure!"

Seriously check this place out if you're in Newburgh... it's centrally locared in their cute downtown and has really great, positive energy.

The space was super clean, the light colors and decoration made a smaller space feel way bigger than it was. Not overdone on wall decor or cluttered with unnecessary furniture. It was a perfect honeymoon type suite. It was incredibly clean. I appreciated the double heads in the shower, the most comfortable bed aside from my own that I have at home, the balcony, the view, the Q-tips for after my shower, and the water in the fridge. Literally, this place was perfect. The hosts thought of everything! A lot of little details and special things to make the stay easy and convenient. OH YEAH, And the complementary coffees from the shop downstairs were so tasty! I love a bold coffee. This whole place and the vibe it puts off is very welcoming and refreshing. Seriously thinking about making this spot a monthly visit! Thank you guys so much!"

The bed reclines so you can comfortably watch TV, the air works great, washer & dryer in unit, remote control fan, don’t get me started on the amazing shower which I now want in a home, complimentary coffee brought upstairs in the morning within two minutes of calling, etc. I could go on and on! We brought our 20 month old with us, and the coffee shop does start early downstairs, so I’d recommend bringing a noise machine. This is a busy area, with a lot of people enjoying the Riverwalk, restaurants, and shopping, but it still stayed quiet upstairs. It was nice to have a full sized fridge and freezer for our little girl’s milk & food. There were a lot of extra cozy throws and pillows to make you feel right at home.

The Airbnb itself was gorgeous. It was very clean and had all the amenities listed in the post. The bed was super comfy! Add to that a laundry set and a very nice cold a/c on a hot day and you have the makings of a wonderful place to stay.
We had a great time there!
Thank you,
Greg and DeeAnn"

The area was safe. It was nice to see the local residents interacting with each other as they took their walks and when they entered the coffee shop/restaurant for more socializing. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay."

My husband and I enjoyed having our morning coffee on the balcony with a stunning view of the Ohio River. The location is perfect, right downtown Newburgh, where you can walk to the shops and a few local restaurants. The trail along the river is also gorgeous to walk! Jessica was so inviting and very responsive. I highly recommend this adorable riverfront loft!"

Stayed one night","Totally safe. Spotless. Beautiful suite. Great location. Amazing double shower. Comfortable bed. Thoughtful touches. 2 balconies. Excellent communication w/ host. What more could one ask for?
This was 1st Airbnb & weren’t sure what to expect. I’ve been to 149 countries and have seen it all…luxurious & scary. Communication w/ Jessica & knowing she was right at hand was comforting.
The location is above a coffee shop which can be delivered in the morning. Just ask! I couldn't carry 2 cups of coffee & hold handrail. Breakfast is available as it is a coffee/ice cream shop.
There were 2 balconies: the front, a view of the Ohio; the rear, a beautiful garden. In the evening I needed a shawl. Jessica had provided one. The location is right on the water: Water Street. This is the place to be. I am not sure when this Airbnb opened, but the interior is spotless. It's like we were the 1st guests. There were no stains, frayed edges or areas discolored.
Thank you, Jessica. We loved our stay."

My only complaint, The shower does seem to lose hot water faster than I would have expected with the water features. The first day both shower heads were on and I thought maybe that was the issue but even with only using one, the hot water ran out before I could take a 10 minute shower.
Even with this being said, I would book this rental every single year!"

Stayed a few nights","The loft is exactly the type of place I want when choosing an Air Bnb. It was unique, clean, and in a great location. The host was prompt to respond when we had a few issues and entry was extremely easy. There are numerous steps to climb so it’s not handicap accessible. I was worried the ceiling height would be low in the loft but it wasn’t. The king bed was comfortable and placed in front of a very large smart TV. Being able to lie in bed and watch barges pass by on the OHIO river was a highlight of our stay though we would have enjoyed sitting outside on the balcony weather permitting. The shower was amazing and the kitchen appeared well supplied. The place is situated on top of a coffee shop and every morning we were awakened around 6:45 am with sounds of entry and grinding of coffee. You can smell coffee in the loft and hear muffled voices, but these things are minimal compared to everything else. If you’re looking for a great place to stay in a great town, this is it!"

The coffee shop below made the room smell of a wonderful coffee aroma. The noise level wasn’t bad at all. Turning in the bathroom fan or music drowns it out. They close at 6 so nights are quiet and peaceful. It was a gorgeous space and very cozy. The bed was absolutely amazing and comfortable. We slept so well! The washer and dryer happened to come in very handy. I LOVED the double headed shower! I did a hot/cold immersion shower and it was invigorating! Could also be used to shower with your partner without having to share the same shower head 😂😂 The next morning we had breakfast at the coffee shop and it was absolutely delicious! Many places to shop and eat in easy walking distance too!

It's not far from Howell Wetlands ( Google: Howell Wetlands / Evansville )
and it's a short drive to downtown Evansville, including Main Street - with its many restaurants, shops and other attractions.
We look forward to writing another glowing review in the not-too-distant future! Thanks for the hospitality, John. :-)"

Stayed a few nights","Dear John and Kylee,
Nama-Stay, a charming cabin tucked away in the woods, is the perfect destination for an enchanting and peaceful get-away. We loved the beautifully crafted woodwork throughout, the many windows filled with sunlit views of the lush green forest, the spacious kitchen, the lovely dining area and comfy living room, lots of plants…and more.
The cabin’s location made it easy for us to get to destinations ranging from the Howell Wetlands to Evansville’s charming downtown Main Street (which has several nice restaurants).
When it was time to go, no one wanted to leave. In fact, the most Zen member of our group, a yogini and plant-lover, practically had to be pulled out of the cabin!
We look forward to a return visit. Thanks for the opportunity and for your hospitality."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I stayed here for two days. It’s a beautiful cabin. I’ll just say for people with knee or mobility issues that it may not be the place for you. I ended up staying in the full-size bed on the first floor, as I just could not climb the spiral staircase due to my bad knees. So my husband stayed up there by himself. But that is on me, because the listing did have this information. Also John has a Keurig coffee maker. There was coffee pods there thankfully. I had brought ground coffee because I couldn’t find the info on the coffee maker on the listing.
Overall, it was such a beautiful, quiet, peaceful setting. I wasn’t crazy about the security lights at night, but surprisingly they didn’t bother me when I was trying to sleep.
The decor and setting was just cozy and charming. I saw lots of squirrels and birds outside, including a hummingbird. The bathroom was nice and had body wash, shampoo and conditioner.
I would definitely stay here again! Thanks, John."

Stayed a few nights","Nama-Stay is a Perfect place to get away. It’s nestled in a beautifully wooded area. Close to downtown Evansville, but far enough away to feel removed from any hustle and bustle. The cabin is very nicely done. Clean and well kept. Peaceful, serene. There is such a calming energy throughout the property. There is plenty of space inside and out. You’ll find books, board games, and yoga mats (with cleansing spray). There is a nice tv, although we never turned it on. There is a fire pit outside. We saw the biggest squirrels and beautiful birds. Be sure to get up and head outside to catch the sunrise. You’ll find everything you could possibly need here. They offered a bottle of wine, coffee, paper towels, bath tissue, shower soap, shampoo, conditioner and so much more. The host is very attentive without invading your space. I highly recommend this beautiful cabin. I am very particular about where I stay and this little gem checked all the boxes. Enjoy! 🙏 Namaste"

Love that it is plucked in the middle of the city , yet feels isolated . Perfect Combo. Very easy to read instructions. We had a great Mom /Daughter trip with family 💕"

Stayed a few nights","Lovely place! I got this as a weekend getaway from my 2 full time jobs as well as a gift to my family for Christmas. When we got there everything was perfect, reminded me of home even. However something to note is that during stormy weather, you will likely lose power due to the amount of trees in the area. I recommend bringing some candles and charging banks during storm seasons, or if the forecast looks dicey. Also the windows are OPEN, so bring a sleep mask if you’re like my mom and need it pitch black."

The location was perfect. Secluded in the woods, with just a couple minutes drive to everything Evansville!
The icing on the cake, my favorite part, when outside, was frequently hearing a faraway train, that I hope I always remember.
Thank you John for letting us and others enjoy the comfort of your Namaste!"

Group trip","Not enough can be said about Nama-Stay, and John.
My only wish was to be able to see it in the green of summer…we were there during the grey of January.
This did not hamper our stay in the least, because we got to enjoy the full scope of the wonderful space for what it is.
The structure it self has been well cared for, and the workmanship is far above what one would find in the area.
DO NOT miss a chance to stay here, if you admire the quiet and solitude that can be had. Almost like stepping back in time, but with modern conveniences."

We even watched deer walk right through the yard while enjoying coffee at the firepit. Super comfy beds, plenty of linens and lots of extras including a bottle of wine for my husband and I to share. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

Stayed a few nights","This was by FAR the best Airbnb experience I have had YET. I live in Mooresville, Indiana, which is about a 2 and a half hour drive from Evansville where this cabin is located. The reason I decided to take this trip is because I wanted a rare weekend to myself, in the middle of “nowhere” away from my day to day routine, because I desperately needed a break. Being a full time working mother of a toddler gets exhausting, and though I wouldn’t trade my life or child for the WORLD, I think it’s important us mommas get a break away from the kiddos even if just for a few days once a year ! 😘😍 no shame ! That being said, I had never gone on a “solo-cation” or any trip by myself before so I was a little nervous . Kylee made me feel so much better about it, letting me know plenty of single females have stayed there before with no issues, and there are security cameras on the outside of the cabin that are motion censored, so even though I was there alone, I didn’t feel unsafe or scared the whole entire time thanks to that reassurance from the host ! The view was BEAUTIFUL. The cabin was cleaner than any other place I’ve stayed at through Airbnb, I was SHOCKED with the cleanliness of the place . The guidebook that the hosts send you with food and attraction recommendations was PERFECT as well, and I went to almost every restaurant and cafe that they recommended! Lol. Only thing that I had wished was that it was a little more secluded than what it was, I didn’t realize there were neighbors on both sides ( not super SUPER close but quick walking distance for sure and I could hear their kids screaming the next morning, but no big deal) :) all in all this stay was everything I had hoped for ! I highly recommend Spankey’s pizza , I ordered this my first night there and they delivered to the cabin and it was AMAZING. “namaste” really is the perfect description for this beautiful cabin, and I hope to make it my annual “mommy’s solo time away” destination annually !"

It feels remote even with neighbors located fairly near, but no one bothered us and it was a very peaceful stay. Cabin was beautiful inside and out. The woodwork on the inside is an amazing feature.

The amenities are also to die for, since the cabin offers a well stocked kitchen, a small entertainment center, and a lovely fire pit outside.

We found the rental to be better than advertised, however would more clearly note that the beds are located in an upstairs loft and bedroom without a door. The open space layout worked fine for our group but might not for others. Thank you John and Kylee for the subtle touches like bottle of wine and abundance of books. It was a lovely stay."

They even had games that we could play. We loved being close to our destination which was Burdette Park. We would highly recommend and definitely stay again in the future.

And in this case, I give them five rolls! 🧻🧻🧻🧻🧻 this cabin is adorable, and it is packed with everything you need to have a comfortable stay. Kylee & John have gone way beyond providing what you NEED, and instead make you feel WELCOMED, starting with a bottle of wine! The location is easy to find, but private and peaceful. The cabin was sparkling clean and SUPER comfortable. We spent our “girls weekend” sitting by the fire with wine, laughing, and reading curled up in the soft chairs and couch. We ordered dinner through Door Dash without any problems or delays. Would definitely recommend & stay again."

Having the ability to cook our own food during our time there was extremely helpful and very much appreciated. Will definitely consider coming back next time in town. Only tip would be to be careful on the gorgeous wood spiral stairs. They can be a little slippery.

The atmosphere is enough to keep you coming back, over and over! The location was easy to find and access. You are 5-10 minutes to shopping, local dining and walking trails. The kitchen is very well stocked with everything you need to cook and serve a full meal. The beds are comfortable and linens made us want to go home and replace our own. There is a twin bed on the lower level, perfect for an afternoon nap. There are two beds in the loft. This could be a small family getaway or a romantic getaway for two."

It was such a beautiful oasis for our family and the teenagers loved it as much as we did. They are already asking to go back. The kitchen is stocked so nicely with everything you need to cook all your meals and even a few spices readily available. The atmosphere wraps around you and is so cozy. Great books on the shelves, and the craftsmanship of the cabin is so unique and something to be admired. The outside area is so nice as well and wood is even provided for the fire pit. Great grill and outdoor lighting for night time. The area is secluded and lots of windows to brighten the cabin up with great views. Although secluded; it is very near to stores, restaurants, and parks with nature trails. The hosts were so very accommodating and help us with every text question immediately during our stay. Thank you! Love all the personal touches that you have been so intentional with in this beautiful oasis."

From the moment you walk in the door you are greeted with the most inviting aroma. You feel like you are in the middle of no where while being just minutes away from entertainment. Kylee and John have created such a wonderful get away. Everything I could have thought of, was in the cabin. EVEN YOGA MATS! Our only regret was that we didn't have time to have the bottle of wine they set out for us. But it's the excuse we will use to come back. Namastay again real soon!"

Stayed a few nights","We loved how private the cabin was! So close (only 10 minutes) to shopping and restaurants--yet when you are at the cabin it was SO QUIET. That was exactly what we were looking for!
There are a few things we specifically want to know when we go stay places--so I want to include them in our review!
1) The bed. My husband and I stayed and we slept in the queen sized bed. For us it was the best combination of firm and soft. Wasn't too firm, but wasn't too soft either.
2) The sofa. I found the sofa to be quite comfortable for napping. It does sit low to the ground and is on the soft side.
3) Kitchen. While this trip we didn't utilize the kitchen besides storing drinks in the fridge--there was PLENTY of items to use had we wanted to cook meals at the cabin.
4) Proximity of Neighbors. While the cabin is secluded from the road and the hustle and bustle of the city--the property does have neighbors on both sides. There is a LOT of space between the cabin and the neighbors and you cannot see into the windows of either house etc. and it was super quiet. No noise was noticed from the other properties. We did see them leave their house a time or two, but nothing that bothered us in anyway.
The hosts were so responsive and kind! We asked for ideas for thrift stores/resale shops etc and they were so kind to give us suggestions! If you do head the the Evansville area, be sure to treat yourself to COMFORT by the Cross-Eyed Cricket. It is a restaurant in the downtown area and it was very good!"

We checked out USI, Burdette Park, Evansville, New Harmony, New Brunswick, the John Audubon State park in Ky, and walked nearby trails. Everything we needed for comfort was well thought out and provided. So many details to enhance the Zen experience-artisan woodwork, decor and design elements, Alexa, the book collection...All in all a truly wonderful stay! Sandy, Larry and Eric"

This location is only 2-5 mins away from the Ford Center which is why we stayed to attend an event. Next time we visit Evansville Indiana we will definitely stay here again!
Thanks Tony & Jill for being Awesome Hosts!!

Stayed a few nights","I was in town for my son‘s wedding, and the entire weekend couldn’t have been any more perfect! Tony and Jill‘s home is beautiful, very clean, and a great place to relax and unwind after long days. The water pressure in the shower was great, and the bed was the most comfortable bed I’ve slept in! I couldn’t have asked for better hosts. They made sure I knew how to get in, and were extremely friendly and personable. They made my first stay in an Airbnb absolutely perfect! I will definitely be back when I’m in Evansville again."

We had an issue that was out of the host's hands and they were extremely responsive in getting it resolved for us.

The home is very clean, comfortable, well furnished and they’ve thought of everything you’d need. I am often alone during my Airbnb stays, so it was nice knowing they were just next door (they communicate well but you have plenty of privacy as I never saw them during my stay). I recharge with a quiet staycation in the area every couple months, but my usual place was booked. I’m glad it was and I discovered this gem, I will be back!"

The house was super clean and seemed more spacious than what we saw in the pictures. There was plenty of room to spread out. There was even enough space to have a few family members over for lunch one day.
Tony and Jill were also very accommodating, and check-in was super easy.

Stayed a few nights","I’m a business traveler that has been all over the world. 30 years of it to be exact. I stopped using hotels when Covid hit and started with ABB exclusively. I’ve seen good ones and bad ones. I’m getting better at spotting the bad ones even if they have good ratings. I’ve found that most people are nice and don’t want to say anything bad about a ABB owners place. I can tend to be that way too I suppose. So I reading between the lines of ABB reviews I’ve discovered that short one line reviews aren’t necessarily a good sign. Example.
Clean
Quite
Friendly host
Those are all good but they didn’t tell you that yes it’s clean but the bed sucked was in a bad neighborhood and there’s no place to park. Anyway my point in this whole rant is to give my honest opinion about this ABB. It’s truly one of the best I’ve ever stayed in. There attention to detail is unparalleled to any I’ve stayed in. Park right in front of the door. 1 step up on the porch and your in. Once your in you will see just how cool this place is. You can definitely tell the owners lived in the space at one point. All the light switches are labeled. The bed is amazing. Better than I have at home. I even asked them where I could buy such amazing pillows. I could go on and on but I think I’m done here. Thank you so much for letting my stay in your great little ABB. Whenever I’m in Evansville this will be the first place I’ll look for."

This home is in the cutest part of town that I never knew existed, it was immaculate, and was the perfect place to have family gather for an evening.
Tony and Jill were beyond kind when I told them this visit in town was a sad one and were quick to respond to any questions that I had. I will definitely stay here again and make sure that my family members know to stay here as well.
* Beds were cozy and comfortable.

Communication from check-in to checkout was seamless. We will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Fabulous space in a walkable location. If you find yourself needing to be in Evansville, or even just near the area...consider staying here!! The property looks just like the photos, has everything you need and Tony and Jill are right next door. During our stay, I needed some dumb bells and a work bench for a work out and Tony provided some and when we needed charcoal and lighter fluid for a BBQ, he came through to assist. Hospitality is top notch, and the surrounding area is historic and quaint with great restaurants. Stay here!!"

Stayed with kids","Haynie’s place was incredible. Tony & Jill were very accommodating and very quick to respond with any questions we had. They were also flexible with check-in and check-out time, which was extremely helpful for our family. The place was very clean and had all of the necessities for a few night stay. The bathroom was my personal favorite, best shower ever!
The neighborhood around the home had a lot of life within walking distances. However, it was very quiet and peaceful when it was time to turn in. This is definitely the perfect place to stay in Evansville!"

The hosts acted quickly to resolve a small issue that arose and ensured we had a work around option while awaiting the fix. We found several enjoyable restaurants and breweries nearby. We were in town for an event at the Ford Center and did not move our car for three days, instead walking to enjoy the businesses in downtown and near the Airbnb. Highly recommended."

Stayed a few nights","We were only in town for a quick weekend, but we loved this place! Everything was so clean and comfortable - it really felt like a space we could call home. Tony and Jill are EXTREMELY responsive and left so many thoughtful touches throughout the home to make us feel welcome.
I’m currently 6 months pregnant and can’t remember the last time I slept so well! Also, the shower was AMAZING! Super clean, spacious and the water pressure was perfect.
There are also so many cute spots nearby - we went to Penny Lane 2x for coffee and a light breakfast, and we also visited Honey + Moon for coffee and waffles.
We are already trying to plan another trip back when the weather is better so we can take advantage of how walkable this beautiful area is!"

Stayed a few nights","We truly enjoyed Haynie's Hangout! If you are thinking of booking, you will not be disappointed. The pictures are accurate and the home was warm, inviting, clean and had everything we needed to spend our 4 nights comfortably. There are two bedrooms, one on either end of the home with comfy beds, bath with shower, kitchen had enough utensils, pots/pans to make our meals, laundry room. A very cute historical home, which we love. It is right in the middle of Haynie's Corners art district with a few restaurants and bars within walking distance. The neighborhood is full of old homes with amazing architecture. Makes for a fun and enjoyable walk. We stopped in at the High Score Saloon for a drink and to play a few video games. If you like old-school arcade games and pinball, this is the perfect place, plus the games are free (pinball 50 cents). Ate at Bru Burger at the old Greyhound. Very good food. Also ate at Gerst Bavarian Haus - if you get the pretzel.. look out! it's HUGE (and delicious). Communication with Tony & Jill was easy and quick. They were kind enough to accept our last minute request to book arriving late that same night. Tony met us outside and welcomed us. There is a car slip behind the house for one car and street parking available. We would definitely stay again and recommend Haynie's Hangout to all. Enjoy!"

The home has been beautifully renovated while maintaining much of its original character. The beds were ultra comfortable, high quality linens, great pillows, slept like a dream. We had a chance to meet Tony this morning before we departed and was a pleasure to get to talk to him. Was also very quick to respond to our questions during the night about the television. This was a great stay, plenty of room to spread out, quiet neighborhood, would love to return to explore the area a bit more."

We enjoyed Walton's and the Pampered Pig for supper. they both have great food, cold brews, and friendly service. The rental is clean, recently renovated, and loaded with character and comfort. The neighborhood was quiet and safe as well, for those who like to walk. My husband and I took an afternoon stroll to downtown Evansville along the river to the casino and back. It was a very enjoyable walk with the river and stately historical homes on either side. We truly enjoyed our stay!"
