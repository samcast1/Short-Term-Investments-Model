Stayed one night","The decoration is okay, but there are a few issues: 1. The sound insulation is very poor and the noise is easily heard from first floor. 2. The windows in the attic have no blinds. 3. The third bed is a sofa bed, which needs to be pointed out in the introduction. 4. The sofa bed is extreme uncomfortable so one of my friends had to go out and stayed in hotel."

Stayed with kids","This Airbnb was everything my family needed and more. My only regret is we didn't get much time to hang out and enjoy it since we were on the go for thanksgiving with the in-laws. The only hiccup we ran into was the furnace wasn't heating but Paul quickly offered and brought a space heater and informed me he would get a technician out immediately. The space fit myself, wife, 2 kids and my mother all comfortably. I'm already looking to plan a return stay this upcoming year."

Stayed one night","We really enjoyed our stay at Paul’s place! It Looked just like the pictures. The bed’s were super comfy, and the place had everything we needed. It was the perfect stop on our way from spending a day at Yosemite, then headed to San Francisco the next morning. My only recommendation would be to add more specific instructions on where to park. We arrived late and just pulled into the driveway - it caused a small “hiccup” the next morning when we were blocked in by the other tenants car, But Paul was super responsive and helped remedy the situation quickly so we could leave on time. Great place though, and I would highly recommend it!"

Stayed a few nights","Super cute place! Perfect for my husband, our 17 year old (which slept and loved the loft) and I. Comfortable beds, great roomy shower and hot water. We didn't use the kitchen much, but has everything you could possibly need. Washer and dryer if needed in the place. Parked on the street, and we were okay with that because it is a good area. Communication with Paul was great.
Keep in mind that it is upstairs, so if you have issues walking up stairs, that may be a problem... Other then that we would definitely recommend and stay there again."

Everything a guest might think of or wonder was prepared & detailed in advance. Rui has taken the guess work & uncertainty out of a stay at her place. It was was a smooth & comfortable experience & I highly recommend her home for your stay.

Your quality of stay depends on the other guests in the house, though. Sometimes it’s quiet if all guests stay in their rooms but other times it’s noisy if guests hang out in common areas or invite other people over. Overall, still a great value!"

Stayed over a week",This has been the best experience I had with Airbnb. Rui and her husband are so friendly and made sure I checked in okay. They come every day to clean even tho the house is hardly ever a mess. They truly make you feel at home. The area is beautiful and quiet. I work nights and have no issues sleeping during the day that’s how peaceful the house is! I will always book with them when I lm in this area.

Stayed a few nights","I had a great stay here ! This was also probably the cleanest Air BnB I’ve ever stayed in and Rui was so responsive to my messages and questions. She even checked in with me to ask how my stay was going. The only downsides were some things out of our control, like the sound of the train at night is pretty loud and as a renter of one of the downstairs rooms, sometimes the sound of renters upstairs was loud, too. Otherwise, the room & house was in a really nice & safe area, there was plenty of parking, Rui was responsive, and the room felt very cosy and well taken care of. There was also an extra personal heater or fan in the room if needed, lots of closet & storage provided, and all the promised amenities on the advertised airbnb post were there too. I would definitely love to stay in one of Rui’s rooms again!"

Stayed one night","We love coming here and it is closer to work for me when I have to leave at 5 am. Hosts are friendly and talkative yet respectful of our privacy. Great parking. I like having full access to use the kitchen. There are clear instructions of where we can put our food in the cupboard and/or fridge and which items you can use. There is coffee and an ice maker. The house is gorgeous, spacious, and clean. There is space in the closet to hang clothes. The washer and dryer available for use until 11 pm. The shower is a little narrow, so it wouldn't be a good fit for someone with a larger frame or for someone who has mobility issues. There is shampoo, body wash, toothpaste/brushes, and hand soap for use. 5 stars *****"

It's close to the freeway, close to Briggsmore and Orangeburg, and close to North Ninth (and Downtown), which gets you just about everywhere you'd want to get to in town very easily.
The house was spacious with a great kitchen, so we were able to host Christmas eve dinner and breakfast at the location. Backyard was cute, the bathrooms were well designed for a family. Overall just a great place."

Stayed with kids","Stacy’s home is very clean, well decorated and private. We needed a four bedroom to come to Modesto for our daughter’s wedding, and we were able to rent the whole house. There are door locks with codes, presumably to rent out on an individual basis as well. Everything that one would need is at your fingertips. The house has pleasant greenery surrounding the property, which gives the yard a feeling of privacy. There are even two outdoor seating areas.
Guests should read the site rules carefully and decide if the home fits their needs. Be sure to ask Stacy questions before renting the home. Stacy quickly responded to my messages clarifying any confusion regarding the rules. Although the site said she allowed pets, in fact, she does not allow pets, specifically dogs, for this property."

Stayed a few nights","Very clean, nice and new! Kitchen was very nice. Beds and bedrooms great. Maybe a bit of a downside would be the living room furniture, it is new and clean but pretty uncomfortable. Not bad for staying in a couple days but if I was chilling out there for a week, I may find the furniture a bit problematic. The hosts were great and communication was great. But overall, an absolutely great experience."

Another great point was she had snacks! I love that. I would definitely book again."

Stayed a few nights","This is a great place for a 3-4 people...it sleeps 6, but that might be a stretch with the 2 bathrooms. In fact, we were surprised to see 3 bedrooms; we thought it was 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. It was very nice and clean, but lacked some small amenities that would have made it more comfortable--kleenex, luggage racks or a dresser, hand soap at the kitchen sink, enough toilet paper. The kitchen was well stocked with dishes, cooking utensils and spices. It was pretty obvious, however, that a tall person either built or rehabbed it; I had to stand on my toes to reach the microwave and the second level shelves. I'm 5'4"". The TV was not easy to figure out and I couldn't find CNN until the last day we were there, but we may be less technologically oriented than some. The outside area was very nice with a working barbeque and a table and 4 chairs. Extra chairs were placed in another spot outside. Overall, a good value for the money."

I travel a lot to the Modesto area and have stayed at a few places here and this one is by far my favorite. Only thing I would say is I wish we could have used the garage. I would pay more just to be able to make sure my car was safe! Lived off of a very busy road too so it was hard to get in and of the driveway too. Very minor things though and will stay here again!

Moreover, Shane's kindness and understanding during a difficult time truly touched our hearts.

NEW or like new, are a big draw for me. Then I read reviews! Every time I had a question- Shane responded promptly and wanted to be sure we were good! Modesto is a hot place in August- but not here! A/C kept us beyond comfortable. Also, houses can have a closed up smell- NOT HERE! It even smelled good naturally! It truly is like a brand new home- NOT WHAT I CALL-“LIPSTICK ON A PIG!” Some of the areas around Modesto are questionable- but here you feel very safe with what appears to be a security system. This place doesn’t disappoint!
Thank you Shane! Well done!"

Shane was incredibly friendly and responsive, to ensure our stay was nothing short of great. Their attentiveness made me feel like a valued guest from the get-go.
As I stepped into the property, I was immediately taken aback by its pristine cleanliness and tasteful decor. Every corner was thoughtfully curated, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The attention to detail was evident in the well-appointed furnishings, stylish artwork, and comfortable amenities, all of which contributed to a delightful home-away-from home experience.

The kitchen had all the necessities you would need to cook meals during your stay.

Stayed one night","Where do I begin? This cute casita was more than suitable for my fiancé and I’s staycation. We were here for about a week and upon arrival, everything was clean and it was very easy to check-in. There was plates, cups, and cutlery in the kitchen, as well as fresh towels in the bathroom. The shower water ran hot pretty fast and the washer and dryer ran more than perfectly for our needs. We couldn’t have hoped for a more welcoming stay. There was a few things I touched base on with our host, Isabel, and she was more than kind. Overall, the stay was great. We weren’t bothered nor disturbed. I’m familiar with Modesto and can agree that this location in which the house sits, isn’t the greatest. Although a little sketchy, we didn’t have any problems with anybody at all. Nobody tried opening the door, no noise, just trains here and there and maybe a dog barking. We very much enjoyed the onsite parking so we could easily see my car, as well as the self locking front door. Would recommend^^"

The Casita was perfect for our needs. I was able to cook full dinners and do our laundry which saved a ton of money and time. It was peaceful and comfortable. My husband happily fell asleep several times in the recliner even though the bed was good!
The hosts went above and beyond to make sure out stay was a good one.
We will definitely rent this place the next time we visit. ❤"

Stayed a few nights","I do not understand where all the great reviews are coming from. This home is located in a very unsafe neighborhood. On our first night someone tried opening the front door in the middle of the night. We felt extremely unsafe after that first night. I do not recommend this home, sketchy people who look like they are on drugs walk this neighborhood. There is a park a block away where you will find homeless people who look like they are on drugs. The home itself is nice and clean, but it’s not worth the dangerous neighborhood. Please take caution if you decide to stay here."

Stayed a few nights","This place was perfect for what we needed. It was clean, convenient, and the hosts were very friendly and responsive. the bathtub looks a lot bigger in person which was a nice surprise. I also like how the bathroom connects to the living room and bedroom so that a person sleeping in the living area doesn't have to walk through the bedroom to use it (both doors lock). The neighborhood is a little sketchy, but it's Modesto - what can you do? my only real complaint is the bed. It's very thin and seems to be slightly too big for the bed frame. It was not a good night's sleep for me :("

Pros: The neighborhood was nice and quiet, the space is comfortable, we were happy to find water bottles in the fridge for us (much needed because of how busy we were on our trip), it's a cute place with the basic necessities. Cons: There was a slight smell of cigarette smoke which we didn't smell after being inside for a while. This con made our stay only almost perfect. The only other thing is be mindful not to trip on slightly uneven flooring between the kitchen and living room. Overall, this is a great choice, we had a comfortable stay. Thank you!"

The house was spacious, and the layout was perfect! The neighborhood was very quiet, and there was easy access to the highway. Our stay was absolutely wonderful. On top of that two days before check out. Angela asked if we would like to extend our stay. With my grandmother in the hospital that took a lot of stress off of us.

Stayed with kids","Angela is a great host. She communicates very well. The house was very clean and exactly as described. I appreciated that she included extra towels based on how many people would be there during our stay (we had 4 adults and 3 children). The kitchen is decently stocked with what you would expect from an Air BnB. There were plenty of mugs, plates, bowls, silverware, etc. Some of the pots and pans were in better shape than others, but at least she had some available. We were able to cook some of our meals during our stay to save some money. She had some spices available, which is always nice. The house is located in a neighborhood on a dead end street, so it was very quiet and there is quite a bit in the area. The grocery store is walkable from the house and it was very nice. There is also a sushi restaurant nearby that we also enjoyed. Overall, we would definitely stay at Angela’s place again"

Stayed with kids","The home was super cozy and cute. I reserved to come up and visit my cousin, and was a little worried because I haven’t heard the best things about Modesto ... but Angela’s home is in a beautiful, and quiet neighborhood. I felt safe and comfortable.
The home itself is cute, and welcoming. My young son kept saying “mom it’s so fancy here. !!” We didn’t use the hot tub or fire pit, but would’ve definitely been a great option if I were on a getaway without kids.
Angela was super responsive and kind.
Would definitely stay here again on another visit to my family."

The home is beautiful, spacious, super comfortable and immaculate.
Kitchen was well appointed with everything you need for a relaxing stay.
While we didn't spend too much time out back, it was beautiful and relaxing during the time we did, (nightcaps and morning coffee).
Hoping this home is available the next time we come up to visit family."

Laurie's instructions were very well written, so we had no problem finding the location and getting in was easy.
The kitchen and living areas were neat and clean. There were some games and puzzles that we enjoyed. The kitchen was spacious and had a great assortment of utensils and cookware.
We only used the master bedroom and the bed was very comfortable. All the bedrooms were a good size. The bathrooms also were nice and had plenty of hot water.
Laurie was attentive and checked in via text. She responded quickly each time I texted and I felt like I could ask her anything. We have stayed at several places around town and this was one of my favorites."

Stayed with kids","The townhome is spacious and laid out well. The kitchen is really big and easy to work in. It is centrally located to the major highway and lots of retail.
There was one glaring problem. The smell of cigarette smoke permeated the entire property. We used three bottles of Fabreeze on the fabrics in the house and out clothing and it did little to help. We were forced to open all the windows whenever we were in the house. The owner told us that this was from the previous tenant, and she was contacting Air B&B about them. I did not and do not believe that. I was a smoker and grew up with smokers. The kind of saturation that we experienced does not happen over a week. It was disappointing that the owner would not waive the cleaning fee. It is my opinion that the house was not clean when we entered because of the heavy smoke smell
That is our only complaint."

Stayed one night","An all over amazing stay! To start off, such a beautiful home and neighborhood.. wish i could have stayed longer! I am wanting to come back asap… Donna is a lovely host and makes you feel right at home! Her beautiful house is kept so presentable and pristine one would want to stay forever! The bed in our room was the most comfy bed i’ve ever slept in, which was much needed after a long road trip drive. Even though we got in late ish, the area was packed with fun things to do and everything was very close together! Donnas place has a beautiful pool and yard which you will never want to leave! I loved her cats as well as i am an animal lover… they made me feel right at home :)! Donna went over and above to make myself and my friend feel safe and comfy, and that was much appreciated as it can be scary being two young women traveling alone! Thank you again Donna!"

In terms of “ceiling” height we did not have any issues, but we are pretty short, probably a taller person would need to duck a little in the bedroom. All in all great find with nice hosts!"

We highly appreciated not having to crawl over each other to get out of bed. We also appreciated being able to walk to restaurants after a long day of driving. Others might consider the location too far to walk to downtown, but not us. The local traffic can get a bit loud sometimes, but the noise was not bad after it was time for us to settle down for the night. We enjoyed some peaceful sleep. We would definitely stay here again."

Walking in the door, it smelled so clean and fresh which was such a pleasant thing in contrast to other stays in the area. Every surface and room felt clean and well thought out. I felt very private and was able to get sleep during the day as the bedroom was relatively dark. Bed was comfy! Shower and bathroom were super cute and everything functioned very well. Loved that there was a washing machine in the bathroom. I had a very short stay and didn’t need to use it, but it was great to have the option! I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would recommend it to anyone who wants a comfortable and private place to relax! Thank you so much:)"

Stayed about a week","The stay was wonderful. it was a smooth easy checkin to their place. The room was as described. I stayed there for 7 nights .Overall I feel it's a good place to stay for two to three nights. They communicated very well and were very courteous.
Just one feedback , the bed was too soft for my back and pillows were a little worn. So it's great for a short stay but maybe that's my personal experience.
And I guess it was mentioned that breakfast will be provided in the description while booking , however we did have some packed food made available by them on day 1 , however not for the rest of the week.
But again overall it was worth the money and stay at their place."

Ginger was always responsive to my messages and I appreciated the willingness to work with me when I had to shorten my stay a little a couple of weeks out from the trip.

Stayed a few nights","Jack and Ginger's place is lovely. It's a great little oasis in a good spot - right off the Virginia Corridor Trail and bike path that feeds into downtown Modesto and connects a few parks. That was the main reason we wanted to stay here. It's also just around the corner from a grocery store (O'Briens), frozen yogurt place, and some restaurants. The home is a 1 bedroom ADU with a spacious bathroom - there's a small seating area combined with the kitchenette right when you enter. Very tastefully decorated that manages to get a lot of natural light. But because it is south-facing, it also stays very cool. It felt very airy and comfortable, and it was also very quiet. The ADU sits behind a gate and has its own entrance. It was very easy to check in and a really quiet and cozy stay."

Stayed a few nights","There are many good things to say about this AirBnB location. The location is convenient for traveling. My wife and I attended a conference in a town approximately 20 minutes from this little oasis. We felt safe, warm, and welcome. They
Ginger, the host kept in good communication before, during, and after our stay. They provided a few snacks for us to enjoy and clean linens, towels, and the place was immaculate.
The only thing I recommend is a larger bed. The double bed is cute, but it's small. There is enough room for a queen or even a king. This would make their place a perfect spot to land while visiting the area.
Thank you, Ginger, for a lovely stay. There is an outdoor pool and cabana that looked very inviting, minus the cold temperatures outside. We didn't use it mainly due to our travel itinerary, but if we had more time I would have definitely enjoyed this nice little bonus."

Stayed a few nights","This was a very thoughtful rental experience. The attention to most details was apparent and the space was cohesive and efficient. The bed slept ‘warm,’ I think due to the mattress protector that didn’t ‘breathe;’ may just be our personal preference. The entrance is in the side/backyard of the attached house and secluded but not completely separate from the area where the dog can walk; a few times we were awoken by the dog barking but it wasn’t constant, just surprising. When we first arrived the AC/Heating unit did not turn on. We did not contact the host because the weather was nice at first but realized when it got cooler at night it would have been nice. It almost seemed like a breaker had been flipped because the next day it was working (could have easily been user error, and like I said we didn’t attempt to contact the host.) It was nice to have the washer and dryer, the rain-style shower head was fabulous, and there was certainly plenty of space to move around with two people, even when getting ready in the bathroom at the same time. Overall a positive experience."

Stayed a few nights","I stayed here for the week while visiting to care for family, which because of the pandemic was a very stressful trip -- but thankfully, I had everything I needed for a comfortable stay in Ginger and Jack's place. The living room space was especially nice, because I could relax there with a family member (wearing masks, of course) to watch a movie in a quiet and comfortable space. We also made use of the outdoor table and chairs. You can tell that the owners put a lot of care into every detail, and the space looks just as pictured. I especially appreciated the complimentary kurig coffee maker and coffee pods! These little touches helped my stay feel more like a home away from home. The neighborhood is lovely and filled with beautiful homes and a walking path nearby, along with a local market, O'Brien's, a few blocks away that came in really handy for meals and coffee! The only thing I might mention is that if you are tall, the bed will be short -- I am 5'5 and it was okay for me, but my husband is 6' and if he had travelled with me I know he would have been uncomfortable. There is a couch that converts to a bed, and it is longer, so I suppose a tall person could use that if needed. All in all I would absolutely stay here again if I need to travel to Modesto in the future. I recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","Ginger’s place has beautiful accents and colors that anyone with an eye will love. Although there is a separate entrance, This space is attached to their home, which I think is something to mention since I didn’t notice it prior to. I felt awkward having a conversation with my husband because the window could not be shut due to the AC vent running threw the window to the outside. It’s seems that this maybe temporary but my husband had to makeshift a curtain for me because I was worried someone could see me undressing through the shifted blinds. Another personal issue, I’m only 5 ft and I could barely see myself in the bathroom mirror (however, there is a full length mirror the the bedroom that worked out well). My brother stayed with us during this time, and there is a pocket door separating the rooms which is handy. Also, The couch is large and pulls out."

Stayed a few nights","This location was perfect for the area of town we wanted. Roseburg Square, a block down the street, has a few of the best options in town- Bob's take and bake pizza, O'briens grocery store and Yogurt Mill yogurt! Also, the Virginia Corridor is a nice walking path nearby. This air b n b overall was a nice place to stay, ideally for 1-2 people because of the full size bed. The air conditioning unit is a plug-in unit in the bedroom so the small living room in front doesn't receive much cool air. The bedroom and bathroom were very spacious. There is no tv in the bedroom and no cable. Even though the home/air b n b is located on a somewhat busy street, we did not hear the traffic inside. The neighbors were very nice. Overall, a simple and clean place to stay."
