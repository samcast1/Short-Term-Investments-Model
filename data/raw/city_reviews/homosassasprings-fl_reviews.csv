Stayed with kids",Papa’s House was a cozy little cabin just out of town. It comfortably fit the 4 of us. It was nice and quiet. Plenty of blankets and towels. Directions to the cabin were clear and concise. Definitely suited what we were hoping for while we were visiting for our son’s soccer tournament.

Stayed with kids","Had a wonderful night's stay on our family road trip. Plenty of space for our family of four. Comfortable, clean and well equipped space. For a relatively small cabin, it felt large inside with high ceilings and surprisingly spacious rooms. Large and clean bathroom, clean towels and toiletries provided. Lovely kitchen area. It was a chilly night but cabin was very cozy with the gas stove. Wish we had a few more days to rest here, but we had to get on the road. It was a much appreciated stop to rest!! Host was very responsive and friendly."

Sadly there was a snow storm coming on the night we were to stay, and one guest had a flight from Phoenix the next day that could not be missed. Tamaki was wonderful in refunding our cleaning fee and dog fee, which was very decent. We were sad to miss Papa's House but we were treated so well in a tough situation, we know we will be back. Thank you."

Our dog had such a blast in the big property they had and we as well had so much fun and it was so beautiful. Our host even had a binder full of recommendations and instructions for certain things and it was very helpful and very sweet. The cabin itself was also very beautiful and very quiet and isolated. We already recommended family and friends and will definitely be booking again!!

The tub was perfect for soaking after a long day of traveling and/or sightseeing. The cabin was also well insulated and stove heater came in handy as the temperatures dropped into the 40's during our stay. Being able to watch the sunrises and sunsets from the cabin were especially nice. Being able to build a fire in the fire pit was a nice treat at night, too."

Stayed with kids","Came to Papa’s House to escape the summer heat and city life with my husband and our two toddlers and it was so very worth it. This is one of the few times where a house is actually is more beautiful in person than pictures. It’s private and quiet, plenty of space in the cabin(we were even able to fit our Pack N Play in the room with our bed for our youngest). It is about 20 or so minutes from town but that wasn’t much of an issue for us since we just needed a few days to rest and recharge. We loved our time here, even our 3 year old was sad to leave “our cabin”"

Stayed a few nights","I was looking for a place that was quiet, remote and not in town. This is a cabin on the hosts property. The photos seemed to show no one nearby but their were neighbors. Most of the properties were large and it was very rural. I was a little disappointed about that but I should have asked more questions. I liked the full kitchen a lot and the interior was very nicely done. The only negative, which was important to me, is the main bed was very hard. This may not be an issue for others but is something good to remember to ask in the future. I slept with the windows open which was a treat coming from Phoenix. It's east of town and an easy commute. Host was responsive and helped me when needed. I would recommend this cabin. You can't beat the price for what you get."

Stayed with a pet","Spent 3 nights at Tamaki's place while participating in a dog show. The cabin is super nice. It has a full kitchen, a separate bedroom, a fold-out bed in the day area, and an upstairs loft. It sits right up against National Forest Land which makes for beautiful views. The neighborhood is very quiet - no noise at all, except for a bit of ambience when trains come chugging by at night. The distance to the center of town may be a bit much for some, but for us the secluded location was perfect. Tamaki herself was super friendly and very quick to respond.
Notes: The bathroom has a soaking tub, not a shower stall. This could be a non-starter for those with limited mobility. Also, we were there at the peak of the 2023 summer heat wave, and the cabin did get very warm during the day. But with fans in most windows it was possible to bring temps low enough to sleep comfortably.
We will definitely try Tamaki's place again, maybe when the weather cools down a bit."

The huge yard was also nice for our Husky, who wanted to stay outside the whole night. The bed was firm and comfy, and the pot-belly stove in the TV area was perfect for a cold night by the fire. It was an effortless experience. MUCH better than staying at a hotel in Flagstaff. Treat yourself to a cabin like this."

Stayed with a pet","Gorgeous cabin, cozy, welcoming, private, great views! Tamaki was a great host, very responsive! The cabin was clean and the bed was very comfy. My phone was only able to connect to wifi when I was in the living room but that definitely did not bother me one bit while I was relaxing in the gorgeous large soaking tub. The water was hot and even filling up the whole tub, I did not run out of hot water! We drove up 89 to the Desert View road into the Grand Canyon via the east entrance (cabin was an an excellent location for that). This path allowed us to take in the Grand Canyon stopping at several of the 8”9 viewpoints with hardly any other people.
We would love to stay here again in the future and take in the stars and even have a campfire!"

A great blue heron was coming to our place every day to check on us pacing the yard and peeking through the window. We took kayaks provided by Tim to paddle to nearby Ellie Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park to watch manatees in pristine clear waters. Would definitely stay in this place again.

Stayed about a week","We were a little hesitant about staying in a home that is someone’s permanent home, but I really loved it! It felt so comfortable and loved in there. The interior was actually nicer than the photos which never happens!
We loved waking up and getting in our Kayaks(they did have a double there too but we had our own) and having our morning visit with the manatees just a light paddle away. We spent all our time on the lovely converted enclosed porch and out back by the water.
The home was so well organized, everything seemed to be just where we expected it to be. I didn’t find myself looking for anything I couldn’t find. The hosts were so responsive, the neighbors were great. I could have stayed forever. I’m a fairly picky airbnber, so that’s saying something! And for my fellow allergy/asthma sufferers, I had no issues. I’m hyper sensitive to mold and Tim communicated when I asked that there was no mold, there wasn’t at all. 10 out of 10."

Stayed a few nights","We needed a few days to get away from it all and chill, and Sheila's place was just perfect. We did plan activities every day--Homosassa State Park, Crystal River, Weeki Wachee State Park, and of course restaurants--but this house is great for just sitting, relaxing, fishing and canoeing if you want.
We often sat out back, watched the wildlife on the river, and read. I could also do my pilates routine on an outdoor rug out there. Sheila had bug spray available, but mosquitoes weren't a problem outside, where it was always cool and peaceful.
I found a couch to perch on and read in the living room. With the help of terrific wifi, we broke our television habit for four days and watched YouTube instead.
Sheila might live there, but she was practically invisible, except when we needed something. like a lightbulb, and she magically appeared. She's lovely to talk with and told us all about how her husband built the property, which we strolled all the way to the ""point."""

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed staying here so much! It was close to town yet you can ‘stay home’ and fish, canoe, & sit by the canal & watch for manatees. We took out the canoe & paddled to the springs, & saw SO MANY MANATEES. During our stay, we caught 25ish hand sized mangrove snappers, a small blue gill, a sting ray, & an 18 inch long large mouth bass and we saw 6 manatee come in/out of the canal (February/manatee season). The canal water is clear enough to where you can see the fish as they are biting your bait. We saw lots of sheepshead, mullet, & stingrays. We also saw an otter twice! As for the house, it was extremely clean & if you had questions, Sheila would get right back to you. Shower had good water pressure & you can sleep on the more firm (but not hard) bed or the pull out with a very cushy and comfy mattress on it (I never thought I would say I slept so well on a pull out couch but it was awesome)! Thanks Shelia for providing a slice of heaven for us for a few days! We had the best time!❤️"

Stayed over a week","We loved our stay in Sheila's unit! She is a wonderful host. This was our forth stay there, and we plan to stay there again.
The unit is basic, fitting our daily needs perfectly. The location is right on the water, very quiet and quite peaceful. Although there is no TV, the internet worked for checking emails and basic streaming needs. The unit is attached to Sheila's house, so it is not entirely private. For us, that was not a problem and we enjoy saying ""Hi"" to Sheila as we see her from time to time during the day.
Thanks Sheila for making your unit available to us, and for the wonderful stay."

Stayed about a week","We had a wonderful, relaxing week on the Homosassa River. The setting is just wonderful, serene, relaxing. Shiela was kind enough to help us launch the canoe. The manatees cooperated... we must have seen 50 that first day. That and the other wild life really made our days memorable. Location is close to wonderful restaurants and interesting adventures. Shiela made us feel right at home. Can't wait to visit again."

Wonderful host and matching accommodation. Nothing to complain about at all.

The only thing I would say is that I wish we could have stayed longer... We will come again....

The location is indescribably beautiful, located directly on the water and with a beautiful garden for shared use. We saw manatees, sharks, dolphins, mantras, water turtles, many different bird species and fish of all sizes. Without a car, we used Sheilas kayak and canoe to explore the area and returned to restaurants right on the river. We would book with Sheila again, it's fantastic!!! The value for money is more than satisfactory. Thank you.

Stayed a few nights","Best waterfront spot for the price! Not modern or new but very clean. Huge bonus, access to a kayak or canoe. There are several kayaking routes to discover from the property. I was fortunate enough to see dolphins, manatees, flying fish, and a whole collection of birds.
The home is attached to the host's home, but your home has its own privacy area. This allowed me to ask my questions and take advantage of his advice. She set up a chair on the tip of her grounds so I could watch the sunrise. She also left me a good dessert.
When you arrive. The unit door is on the left and carries the Air B&B badge in the window. The front door opens into the big room. The living room is in the back with a door leading to the grounds and large windows overlooking the water. The screened-in gallery is for the owner but she invites us to use it."

It was fun to sit and watch the boats go by and from the property we say hawks, hummingbirds and other assorted birds. We took our boat to the spring and it was beautiful, glad we got there early on Mothers day because it can be very congested on the weekends and holidays, while we were there we saw a manatee, snook, mullet and other people told us they saw otters further up river. It was overall a great weekend and we will be back. Thank you again Sheila."

Then to the back is the living area with the sleeper sofa. This area has a view of the water and a door to the backyard. There is a tandem canoe and solo kayak available. I went kayaking one day and we enjoyed canoeing the next. Homosassa Springs is a short distance away. We saw plenty of birds and were thrilled with the experience of kayaking in the area of a mother manatee and her two calves. Sheila is an excellent host and we enjoyed talking with her.

The set up in the apartment is very smart in how the bedroom and living room area with sofa bed is separated by the kitchen area. That helped to create a noise buffer between sleeping areas for my friend and I. Beautiful setting right at the water and very nice neighborhood. Very quite and calm. My friend even saw a dolphin the one morning. Check in and check out were a breeze. Sheila was great with communication and such a sweetheart. She even left a delicious hand made breakfast pastry in the fridge. Very clean accommodations. Loved the tile shower.

Stayed a few nights","Shelia is an exceptional host, offers and explains her home, amenities and the surrounding area. We enjoyed and used the canoe and kayak availability every day almost! It was so nice to have firewood available also to have a fire by the water one evening. There is so much to enjoy without even leaving the property! Grilling, swimming, canoeing, kayaking, sun bathing, fishing, enjoying the sunset, watching the water traffic, water life and beautiful surroundings. It was a wonderful and unique experience fit for all ages. It definitely did not disappoint. Of a 12 day Florida vacation that started with a week at a beach resort on the east coast, this was my son’s absolute favorite part of vacation. This was the perfect end to our trip. The manatee festival was taking place the weekend we were visiting, in the next town over. There was plenty to see and do all around. Stores for most all needs are very close. Everything was wonderful- host, location, experiences, amenities. We will definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights","This waterfront apartment was perfect for our 4-night stay in Homosassa/Crystal River. The 2 of us certainly could have stayed longer as it is comfortable, convenient and an excellent value. The apartment is so much more spacious than a hotel room and the water views are spectacular. We enjoyed coffee in the morning, from the living room area which provided gorgeous, peaceful views of the water. Additionally, there is a patio just outside the apartment, where we sipped coffee in the morning and wine in the evening, while viewing the water and listening to so many birds. From the patio we saw heron, wood stork, ducks and so many other birds. It appears to be a very healthy ecosystem.
There's a kayak, canoe and rowboat on the property, although we did not use them since we brought our own kayaks. We launched from the backyard, right into the canal and paddled 5 minutes to the spring to see the manatees, which were plentiful during late March. We were treated with being able to view at least 15 manatees in a short time period, many of which swam right under our kayaks and were easy to see in the clear water. We also enjoyed walking around the safe neighborhood either early morning, or after dinner.
Other reviewers have commented about the squeaky springs of the queen bed in the bedroom. Yes, the springs are noisy when first sitting on the bed, however we found the bed to be comfortable and we slept well. The apartment is easy to find using GPS and is located on a quiet, safe, cul-de-sac. The location provided peaceful sleep and beautiful, dark starry skies. Sheila is an excellent host who provided helpful information for the area. While she lives in the attached home, she was respectful of our privacy, and accessible if we had questions. We greatly enjoyed our stay and will certainly return."

Paddle under the bridge for some magical scenery. Sheila was very gracious and respected our privacy. We used her washing machine at the end of our stay and dried our clothes on the clothesline. The bed is squeaky and could be replaced, but was very comfortable. You might want to bring something to cover your eyes to block out the morning sun in the bedroom."

Stayed a few nights","This is an ideal place to stay, it is quiet and very comfortable. The canal in the back yard was great to utilize Shelia’s canoe/kayak to be up front and personal with the manatees. Shelia was very gracious and helpful with ideas for things to do and places to see/eat.
I would highly recommend staying here..... you won’t be disappointed!"

Stayed over a week","Sheila was a wonderful, friendly host and her apartment was just as she describes in her listing. It suited us really well, especially at such a great price. The setting is absolutely lovely--facing out on the canal as well as the expanse of the Homosassa River. Sitting in the shade (or sun-it has both) of her yard is a great place to read , if you can tear yourself away from watching the ibis, storks and herons in the surrounding yards.
The apartment suited our needs very well. Although some reviewers had negative comments on the bed, we found it very comfortable. The bath is beautiful with a great shower head and plenty of pressure. One thing we found particularly useful was the set of TV trays that we could use to give us extra surface space where we needed it. We would definitely recommend it for a single or couple staying in Homosassa."

Stayed a few nights","I purchased four days at Sheila’s place for my parents to get some FL sunshine. It was a lovely spot, the place was clean, but the bed was terrible. Very hard and squeaky, and they spent three of the four nights on the sleeper sofa instead. I’ve found AirBnB places to be hit or miss with the quality of the mattress. I don’t expect 5-star luxury for the price that I paid, but I do strongly feel that a comfortable bed should be your top priority as a host. If she remedies this, it’ll be a great spot."

Stayed a few nights","Pros: very clean! Central to all things & activities around Homosassa, close by to stores & restaurants. Nice to be so close to the canals, and you can see fish literally jumping out of the canal. Host supplied some breakfast rolls and coffee, nice touch. Check in very easy, really low if any crime in area. One peculiarity-while there’s a canoe & paddle board on site, host refused to let me use paddle board, though to be fair the listing doesn’t feature that. The canoe was available but the life jackets were stored in a container/trunk that contained gas, and the smell of fuel predictably saturated those so we didn’t use them.
Cons: There is a very small coffee maker on site, and there were no microwave safe dishes except for a single dinner plate. The bed is very squeaky, and was a bit soft. The air conditioning system seems to be on two different duct runs, one for each the sitting room and the bedroom. The sitting room was noticeably cooler than the bedroom.
Overall: very reasonably priced, but the cons for us outweighed the pros, other opinions in other reviews differ. Either we are pickier or those renters are more tolerant, the above are my honest thoughts. If on a budget, this is a decent place to stay."

Stayed about a week","Me and my family stayed here for 9 days and enjoyed it so much.
The location is stunning and the back deck and dock made a great spot for morning coffee and evening fishing.
Which by the way…you catch fish constantly and might see a gator or two!
We ended up buying 4 fishing poles and donated them to the house :)
We took a day to go to Crystal River (25min away) and a couple days spent at Hunters Beach (15 min away highly recommend) to swim with manatees, go kayaking with the provided kayaks, and tan.
We even drove and hour 35 to Disney and spent a long day there.
This location was great for short trips but not if you want a ton of restaurants. That was the only limitation of the location. However with a Publix at the top of the street and the grill, we had fun enjoying family dinners together at the house.
As of group of 4 the place worked great. Any more and I could see it getting a little tight as the pictures make it seem a bit more spacious. The kitchen was workable."

She has kayaks, fish traps and a dock where fish jump out of the water and beautiful birds visit near. We got to see lots of native birds and wildlife on the docks. Easy to figure out access, nice view—exactly as advertised. This is close to attractions like Homosassa Wildlife state park-less than 10 minutes away(dogs aren’t allowed in park due to captive wild animals , but kennels provided). 10 minutes from Monkey Island! It had many restaurants that were dog-friendly patio and less than an hour away from beautiful Rainbow springs-there is a dog friendly kayak place there—we really enjoyed our trip there with the dogs—I was unfortunately attending a funeral near, but it was a relief to be in such dog-friendly welcoming home (she even had dog treats & bowls, little Nick knacks like dog paw pillows and books). Homosassa was friendly to us and dogs"

Stayed a few nights","Very cute place, love the outside porch area on the water, the dock, and the kayaks! It had everything you could possibly need to cook with in the kitchen and tons of towels, hand towels, wash cloths, etc. even has lots beach towels!
Was a little difficult to park our 29ft boat but she warned us ahead of time that it would take some maneuvering. Very good communication thru out our stay and before our stay! Overall we were very pleased!"

We did run into an issue with some toiletries but our host was very responsive and fixed it asap. Good reminder to check the toiletries are there earlier as all stores close by 9 and the issue cannot be remedied until the next morning. Would stay again.
Other things of note it has a grill and the neighborhood is nice and quiet."

Kitchen was very well appointed. Host was very accommodating and provided plenty of amenities.

The property was just perfect for what we were looking for and Sunday was very accommodating with everything. The sunsets were spectacular over the water. Fishing off their dock was successful with a few catches of fish. My wife again out fished me! :) Thank you Sunday for an unforgettable stay. We most likely will return at some date in the future.

I spent a lot of time sitting on the bench swing on the dock, watching the wildlife. From that bench I saw egrets, herons, barred owl, ducks, pelicans and a huge mama and baby manatee swam under the dock. Sunday was incredibly sweet, bringing over fresh baked cookies, breakfast and was always available if we needed anything. We biked all around town and took the kayaks out on the marsh for a paddle. I cannot wait to go back and stay for longer. Best air bnb experience I have ever had. Thank you!"

We were off to a great start with extra-easy check-in and directions because we would be arriving late.
The studio was exactly as described and perfectly appointed, but nothing compares to the beautiful property and the hospitality from Sunday and Sal - including a spectacular breakfast and tour of the grounds! We sipped coffee (and cocktails) on our private beach, our perfect deck, on Sunday and Sal’s dock swing, and in their hot tub overlooking the water. We spent hours exploring in the kayaks. We chilled with Charlie the cat and fed Humphrey the tortoise a few flowers.

The most Relaxing 😎 place we have ever been to, & the bed is comfy, & there were 2 days we didn't get out of bed until after 2:00 pm!! 😆 When we finally did get moving, we had coffee out on the covered swing overlooking the water & watched the fish jump. Then we used their kayaks to do a wonderful exploration, & finished our day with a soak in their crystal clear hot tub, also with a fabulous view of the water! They had bicycles we could have explored their adorable neighborhood with, but we were enjoying relaxing too much...😆
Their outdoor cat Charlie is a LOVE, & greeted us with joy & purrs....
Wish we could have stayed a week or two longer!!!!!!
Thanks Sunday and Sal, we can't wait to come back! ￼💕"

We like to kayak over to Homosassa Springs and see the manatees and then paddle up to Shelley's Fish Market for fresh stone crab or steamer clams to cook up for dinner. This airbnb is a true gem, one of a kind, exceptional, beyond compare. Do yourself a favor and check out the River Pearl.

We fished from the dock a lot and having the huge swing was so comfortable I could have lived there!!! The kayaks are on a lift so getting in and out are effortless! We easily paddled for lunch at one of the several cool restaurant on the water.

Stayed a few nights","This was our second time staying here, we loved it so much the first time. Everything is so peaceful, this is not a place for partying or a million things to do. This is a place to slow down, unwind and enjoy every moment. We took advantage of the many amenities: the private beach with the fire pit, use of kayaks, the jacuzzi, extremely comfortable bed, fully loaded T.V., everything we needed in the kitchen, as well as the INCREDIBLE breakfast. We’re vegan and were blown away every morning. The wild birds are abundant and if you’re lucky you’ll see dolphins, manatees, and gators. Thank you for another incredible stay and your exquisite hospitality, we will be coming back for as long as you’re in business."

All toiletries provided, even 2 bathrobes, which was a nice touch . We enjoyed a lot of relaxation time sitting on the wide deck and on the private “beach” area watching the canal and the sunsets.

Stayed a few nights","Two words that describe this place is: affordable luxury. We are so grateful for the 4 peaceful nights we spent at The River Pearl. We LOVE kayaking and spent hours and hours in the kayaks on the peaceful inlets. It was so easy with the boat lift that puts you right into the water and lifts you back out.
The jacuzzi was perfection. The loft was perfection, clean, comfortable, quiet, and had everything we needed. Our private beach and fire pit was perfection. One night we got out of the jacuzzi and we heard blows, there were dolphins splashing around right by the dock!!
One word of advice: do not kayak near the shore during/close to dusk, a tidal wave (alligator) launched into the water after a fish, very close to my husband. That was a rush...
We saw manatees, herons, pelicans, bald eagle, cormorants, osprey, seagulls, egrets, and the monkeys at Monkey Island, I named them Peter, Paul and Mary. It was lovely feeding flowers to resident tortoise Humphrey Bogart and giving pets to the fluffiest cat Charlie.
And finally, our hosts. Sunday is a goddess mermaid and her compassion for others shines. She is so very kind, laid back, and welcoming. She made us 2 phenomenal homemade vegan breakfasts, delivered to our door. Sal is such a kind soul, also so welcoming and laid back.
We work hard at home. We needed this vacation badly, it did not disappoint, and we absolutely cannot wait to come back.
Much love,
Melanie and Jay

Stayed a few nights","This place lives up to the description and the glowing reviews! Sunday is an amazing and natural hostess. The waterfront location is outstanding. There are an endless amount of things to do in the area but you could also spend the whole time at this property and not be disappointed. Both the private and common spaces are designed for beauty, comfort and relaxation. This place truly celebrates the beauty of living on the river. Thoughtful touches throughout the cottage make the space comfortable and relaxed. We especially enjoyed kayaking, hanging in the hot tub at sunset and meeting Charlie the cat and Humphrey the turtle. Sunday took the time to give us a tour and chat with us about her beautiful gardens which we enjoyed very much. And you the breakfast! You won’t find a better breakfast anywhere! Seriously this is above and beyond a 5 star stay. Don’t hesitate, book it now!! You won’t be disappointed."

The private beach with the fire pit was pure serenity in the evenings with the sunset. I loved the fact there is a lift for the kayak's, it was a plus for me with a bad knee. Sunday and Sal are so down to earth and we felt comfortable to do whatever we wanted on the property. We can not wait to visit the tranquil views and relax again in Homosassa! it will definitely be at The River Pearl!!"

Her attention to detail makes you feel comfortable and at home. She provides all your basic essentials of toiletries and water.
The property is absolutely beautiful being right off the water. She has a private beach with chairs and fire pit, along with bikes and kayaks for your personal use. And to our surprise, surrounded by fruit trees is an adorable tiki bar and chair swing overlooking the water. A perfect place to watch the sun rise and set. If you are looking for a place to get away to from all the chaos, River Pearl is a priceless gem."

Things we enjoyed - sitting on the amazing swing by the water, watching the jumping fish, Charlie the cat greeting us outside in the morning, delicious breakfasts!! (seriously yum), Humphrey Bogart the turtle, beautiful accommodations, coffee on the beach, kayaking, beautiful sunsets, the property is so beautiful it's like an oasis .......so many things!
Luckily the tropical storm turned when we were there but we still had a lot of rain. Not a bad place for some quiet time and relaxation. This is the place to quiet your mind and provide healing.
Locally - recommend the Wild Sassa Food Trailer had great shrimp tacos (a big group next to us had the red snapper and said it was amazing they even ordered more)
Florida Cracker Monkey Bar- great crab dip (and we are MD people so we are picky) and delicious pizza
Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park - fun to see lots of animals
Thank you Sunday and Sal for welcoming us to your home and giving us a wonderful stay. We hope to be back soon!"

The cottage had many added little touches that you don’t often find at other Airbnb’s or vrbo rentals: coffee and filters, bathrobes, cold water in the refrigerator, body wash, & even a few little snacks on the table. Had plenty of privacy, with Sunday available to help if necessary. The fruit trees and gardens on the property are lovely …. you even have your own private sandy beach.

We found their place clean, well-equipped and plenty roomy for two. We enjoyed paddling around in kayaks and would like to have had more time to enjoy the many amenities they offer. Sunday had several good suggestions for dinner. Wallace's At The Greenhouse was a good place for casual dining. If you have a passion for food, we would highly recommend Catch 22; here we enjoyed the ""Catch of the Moment"" (Cobia) and Maryland Style Crab Cakes. Like all guests, we were given the royal breakfast treatment by Sunday and Sal; it was delicious and the portions were generous. The check in and check out times were most generous, as were our hosts, Sunday and Sal. We wish we had more time to enjoy the ""The River Pearl"", which is a very peaceful, quiet and serene slice of paradise on a small tributary of the Homosassa River."

Stayed one night","Paradise found! If you're looking for an amazing place with views, charm, special touches and an outstanding host to experience all Florida's Nature Coast has to offer look no further. The River Pearl cottage is perfect. Sunday, your host, makes the place feel like it's yours. The property is full of Florida character, warm and welcoming with high-end resort qualities. The cottage is cozy, spotless clean and well-appointed with a large deck that overlooks the water, salt marsh, palms, cedars and pines that make up the beautiful Homosassa landscape. The extra large dock is an adult playground with a tiki bar, hot tube, swings, and other comfortable places to hangout and relax, plus you're own sandy beach and firepit just for the quests of the River Pearl. For boaters, there's plenty of dock space and room to park your vehicle and trailer. Literally Sunday has thought of everything possible, including a great breakfast in the morning to make your stay perfect. I can't wait to return."

I so appreciated the kitchen and wonderful extras that made the times we did not want to eat out very easy. Dana has thought of everything guests might need. It was so kind of her to put a small basket of snacks on the kitchen counter for us. I don't know if it was a coincidence or not, but many of them were gluten free and therefore, I could enjoy them, as well. We appreciated the paper products the cleaning supplies the items like oil, spices and tools that vacationers do not want to purchase. The door entry lock, the temperature control , the washer and dryer, microwave and stove were super easy to use. Lastly, Dana is a great communicator. I texted a few times to ask her questions and she responded right away with helpful answers and a kind demeanor. It was such a pleasure to stay at Relaxing Retreat 2!"

She also had an available a few kayaks but we didn’t have the time to take them out.

We visited Ozello a couple times. Once for Peck’s lunch on the water and another time for an early eco pontoon boat tour. You MUST visit florida cracker / monkey bar for pizza on the upstairs deck. MUST visit Homosassa Wildlife Park to meet the local hippo, Lu, and the young bear, Max.
The kayaks were great—although one seat for the white kayak did it seem to fit. So we could not go as a family of 4, but we too turns. We saw river otter each time we went out."

Stayed with a pet","Lovely, tasteful decor, kitchen with new utensils, pots and pans, everything to make a relatively complicated meal (which I did). Great outdoor space with picnic table and couch. We did not use the firepit or grill...vegetarian daughter, but they looked nice. Not really possible to get to the main area of Homosassa State Park (where the water is clear) from our canal, unless you made a whole day of it. But a fun, quiet place to paddle around without that many bugs. Lots of birds, did not see any gators or snakes. Very peaceful."

My daughter And family came in their RV, and stayed near us.@ Nature Resort
Her dogs really enjoyed the great yard and laying in the sun. We spent many hours exploring the water ways with the kayaks. Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","This ABNB is spacious and welcoming as you enter the front door. The floor plan is simple, both bedrooms have their own spacious bathrooms. The back porch is screened in overlooking the back yard and fire pit. Great spot to spend an evening with family and friends.
The nights were chilly and we used the fireplace which was a warming touch. Tractor Supply had the best price for firewood.
While fishing from the dock, a large blue herring flew and landed on a building within 5 ft of us. It was a beautiful site. It then flew down and landed on our dock right in front of us. Wow
Kitchen was well stocked and had everything we needed.
If you like to see some wildlife, including manatees, I recommend
Homosassa State Park. It is close by, reasonably priced, peaceful and an easy walk.
The ABNB host were prompt and great to work with."

Stayed with kids","Fantastic house, unbeatable location! Lovely hosts were nearby to answer any questions and provide local knowledge. We trailered our boat (25') and it fit perfectly at the dock with trailer parking on site. It was wonderful to be able to look out the windows at night to check on the boat. Having storage under the house immediately next to the dock for tubes, floats, snorkeling gear, etc was exceptionally convenient. Kids loved dropping in lines off the dock for bass and blue gill and rumor has it mangroves frequent , too. We were there to scallop so being on one of the furthest west canals off the main span of the river put us close to the Gulf while ice/fuel/cocktails/food were a short ride to the east and the springs just past. If you're not local, you'll want to be on one of these main river span canals as it's a pretty unforgiving backcountry, we were grateful to be in well marked canals/channels so we could relax and enjoy our time! House was perfect, comfortable and clean with everything we needed, blender included! We cooked nightly and appreciated the well stocked kitchen. We'll be back!"

The attention to detail and the little things that went the extra mile shows that they take pride in their rental. There was a small bucket with things like shaving cream, feminine products, sun screen ...etc incae you forgot to bring your own...hotels don't even have that kind of service.
They made the door code the last 4 of my phone number...hard to forget that.
That is the little stuff that matters.
If we go back to Flagstaff, this is where I'm staying."

There was absolutely NOTHING needed and lots of special extra touches from applicances and personal items to great snacks! Its convenient to all of Flagstaff, and one can easily avoid Rte 66. The porch (heater) and patio (fire pit) are lovely to sit and just relax and enjoy the cool summer breezes..we're from Tucson where it was over 100. Inside, the furnishing are tasteful, the bed comfortable, the shower large (rain shower head), and the kitchen area is beautiful. It has full sized grey stainless steel appliances and all the tools. Lots of spices, coffee, tea, extra ice, etc. are all there. The shelves are beautiful live edge mesquite! The TV has all the streaming channels one could want, including Amazon and Netflix. And, of course, the hosts are right next door, friendly and available. Who could ask for anything more."

I even left an item behind and they are doing to mail it back to me. This is the place I’m going to stay EVERY TIME I come back to flagstaff! Well done!

Stayed one night","Renee and Carlos host a lovely little home! Plenty of amenities and some extras! Every inch of the space was very clean and so cozy! Their pictures for check-in were accurate and very helpful, it was easy to find the spot and get inside. The space is so smartly built and arranged. The shower is SO NICE. There was even a cute little basket of snacks to enjoy.
I arrived with a friend to stay the night before going on to the Grand Canyon. Weather was not on our side and we didn't end up making it to the Canyon, but Renee was kind enough to check in with us about the weather, let us know about road closures in the area, and even let us check out late so we could wait until roads were clearer. The sidewalk and stairs were shoveled and salted, as was the driveway behind my car. Our only regret was not being able to stay in this cute tidy space a little longer, if you're coming to Flagstaff definitely check this spot out!"

The kitchen was my favorite part it had everything I needed to cook and I was so appreciative of the coffee maker PLUS the provided coffee, filters, sugar, and cream.

Stayed one night","We were traveling across country and were unable to get to our original airbnb because we got stuck on the muddy roads. SIX people had to push us out. We were cold and discouraged. HOWEVER…when we got to THIS airbnb we felt right at home. We requested to stay there about an hour and a half before we got there and they accepted the request right away. They pre heated the place and cleaned it themselves since their cleaning lady did not show up. They were very sweet over the phone and their home and the airbnb are both gorgeous. The shower was remarkable, the kitchen was beautiful, and my fiancé and i agreed that we would even decorate our future home like that. They had ECO FRIENDLY appliances and their kitchen had all of the right supplies for anybody. They also live in the cutest little town ever :). We LOVED our stay here and would recommend it to anybody"

But like I said very nice and clean and cozy. And it would have been nice to use the fire outside and hangout. But everything was covered in snow. Snow expected but I just thought that area would have been cleaned up before us getting there. My girls were a little disappointed and we did not get to do our s’mores.

Every corner whispers stories of serenity, inviting one to unwind in its tranquil embrace. The host's warmth felt like a family member. It resonated beyond mere hospitality.
Each sunrise painted the rooms with a golden hue, awakening a sense of wonder within. As the moon cast its ethereal glow, the night sky became a canvas for dreams. In this ethereal abode, one finds not just a place to rest, but a sacred space to reconnect with the soul's whispers and the universe's gentle embrace"

Stayed with kids","I will start by saying this place is great and Chris is absolutely amazing. This cabin is beautiful. We enjoyed all the little nick nacks and decorations. The is in a private area and very close to the snowbowl. It's very relaxing and has some pretty neat features. Highly recommend, especially during the busy season.
Cons: The cabin was very dusty and sorry to say, but the floors were dirty too. This place needs a good cleaning. We had a 10 month old with us, and it's important to be clean.
2nd - The power went out 4 times in the middle of the night over a two day stay. Chris helped provide direction on how to start the generate. Overall: 4/5 Stars"

The lodge itself is so thoughtfully decorated and comfortable that you feel like you are staying at a friend's well-appointed home; I especially loved the cozy little reading nooks that were perfect for relaxing with a good book. The kitchen had lots of supplies, and in addition to the well-appointed interior, there are great places to hang out outside on the front patio and an outdoor fire pit. The location is great, too; nice hiking nearby, and less than an hour from the south rim of the Grand Canyon, Wupatki and Sunset Crater N.M.s, and lots of good restaurants in Flagstaff only 15 minutes away. We would love to come back another time soon! :)"

Stayed a few nights",Chris was a fantastic host and the property is exactly what I was looking for. First weekend up in flagstaff and Chris's guidebook was very helpful as well. The property itself is extremely cozy and very clean. Obvious instructions for use of the wood burning stove that made each night dreamy. 10/10 would recommend to anyone else looking for a cabin in the woods up in flagstaff with a great location but still feeling secluded.

Stayed with kids","The cabin and location were awesome. The only things that made it a bad experience were that there was no microwave and no wifi, and the dvd player didnt work or wasnt connected to the tv properly. I also would have appreciated if they came out to try and fix the wifi instead of just messaging us to restart it or saying they would call about it the next day. I was there with my family on a working trip and was unable to do any work and I didnt have any cell service either with at&t. We also didnt know until check in that we had to remove all the bedding and towels and put them in the laundry or do the dishes etc. Just please be more transparent and honest and have a little more quick customer service going forward. I will however not be staying there again."

He keeps the road clear when snowing. One downside is that our internet connection and therefore TV was poor though out most of our stay (too slow to stream anything on TV or any other device). We made Chris aware that this was advertised as an amenity, and he said that the dish was covered in snow and apologized.
Would recommend the place for families with kids as well as adults only groups. We had so much fun!"

Stayed a few nights","Chris's cabin is wonderful - we really can't recommend it enough. It's even more charming than the photos suggest, and our family declared it one of the best places we've stayed!
After a couple of nights in hotels on our trip around National Parks, this cabin felt like an oasis - and with a huge washer and dryer and plenty of hot water (despite being an off grid cabin), it really allowed us the chance to clean up and recharge. Even though it's a 2 bedroom there was plenty of room to spread out. And although we were there during snow so didn't get a chance to use the outside spaces - I can only imagine how nice it would be to sit on the covered front porch in slightly warmer weather and take in the amazing view.
Chris was so welcoming and helpful and genuinely a super host.
(One thing to mention - the upstairs 2nd bedroom is accessed by a spiral staircase which is totally stable and secure, but just something to be aware of if your group has really little ones or anyone who is a little unsteady on their feet.)
This really is a perfect cabin - highly, highly recommend!!"

The lodge was amazing, every corner had a unique piece of furniture or decor to look at, and the kitchen had all the essentials for cooking (utensils, pots, dishes, spices), so we just had to buy food and drinks. Chris and his son were very accommodating and even gave recommendations of where to go sledding and where to eat. It was snowing when we went so the kids had plenty of space on the property to play in the snow, it was awesome!"

Stayed about a week","This is a great stay for anyone looking to be out in the woods for a few days. The cabin itself has all the amenities one might need. The photos are spot on and do a much better job than me of describing the cabin. It is close to Grand Canyon, numerous trails and places to explore in the Coconino and Kaibab National Forests, and it is a short trip back to Flagstaff for supplies or just to visit Flag.
While there is wi-fi, it is way off the grid so don't come expecting highspeed broadband. Email and web surfing is fine. Streaming is spotty. But you didn't come out here to stay inside and watch Netflix did you?"

The property borders the national forest so you are surrounded by ponderosa pine and aspens. It is a perfect place to get away from city life and be immersed in nature. We can’t wait to go back!

The view alone is worth the price and stay, but then you have this amazing cabin to curl up in and relax with your family or even just yourself. Everything about this stay is extremely friendly and professional. All the way down to the bedding, which we are absolutely in love with. Host was extremely nice and accommodating and gives you a brief history of the place which just makes you fall even more in love. We will definitely be coming back."

Stayed a few nights","Amazing place! This property is very cool. The main house has plenty of room for several guests. The downstairs bed is very large and comfortable. The bathroom has double sinks and a really neat stone shower/bath. Super comfy bedding and towels. The kitchen had everything we needed and the grill was great. We loved the extra large table outside for dining al fresco. The couches in the living room were nice. The décor is amazing. A couple of our kids used the pull out couch to sleep on. The upstairs bed is good size and the bathroom is pretty nice with a standup shower.
We didn’t need to use the 2nd cabin but it had enough room for another couple. The yurt also looked like a fun place to stay. The property is well maintained and has a koi fish pond. There was a thunderstorm and we saw a huge double rainbow afterward. We had planned to make a fire outside but didn’t have time with all the fun stuff to do in the area. We ate at a few restaurants downtown and all were wonderful. We visited Bearizona which was less than an hour away and a really neat lava park not too far away – Sunset Crater Volcano. We definitely recommend this place. Chris was very nice!"

Stayed a few nights","First, the scenery at this place is amazing. My Wife and 3.5-year-old Son shared this place with two other couples. One couple had a 1.5-year-old, and the other couple had an eight and nine-year-old plus an infant. My Wife and I got there early and were met by the owner's Wife. She was super nice, and gave a good run-down on the place. We were initially a little surprised when she told us her Son and Fiancé were staying in the cabin directly next to the main cabin and another family was staying in the Yurt. Not a huge deal, but it might be a deal breaker for other renters to know that the owner's Son is literally staying in a cabin about 25 feet away. I would inquire about this if you are interested in this rental property. In terms of the sleeping situation. The main cabin has a king bed in the master bedroom with a full-bath. The living room has a pull-out sofa about the size of a twin bed. Upstairs has a queen bed, and a pull-out sofa which is also about the the size of a twin bed. Upstairs has a full bathroom. The main cabin is nice. The kitchen had everything we needed. Moths/insects/flies were a bit of an issue, but the place is completely off the grid so it did not bother anyone. Downstairs in the main cabin it was easy to regulate temperature with the windows/verbal instructions the owner provided. However, upstairs was significantly warmer than downstairs, and it was borderline uncomfortable to take a nap upstairs and fall asleep at night. A fan upstairs is highly recommended. We stayed from 31 June - 4 July. The Wi-Fi worked great, but we never tested out the television. However, the main cabin did have some sort of satellite service. I would also inquire about the washer and dryer. The owner did not mention it, but the 9-year-old seemed to find his way past the locked door in the master bedroom where he discovered a utility room of sort with a washer and dryer. The outdoor patio was one of our favorite parts about the main cabin. During the day, and in the evening, it was great. There is a nice Weber grill and furniture to sit about 8 people. The other cabin was also neat, but is just a place to sleep. If I remember here is a queen or full bed plus a another twin size bed. There is no bathroom or shower in this cabin. Again the other cabin was occupied by the Owner's Son, and the Yurt was occupied by another family. The Owner's do not allow pets, however the other two couples we shared the place with brought their dogs. I told the owner this shortly after we arrived as soon as I found out the animals were coming. Understandably I could tell she was not pleased, but she was very understanding and allowed the two dogs to stay..."

Stayed a few nights","Thundercliffe Lodge is an authentic rustic yet immensely comfortable cabin nestled into the forest surrounding the highest mountain peaks of Arizona. Even in June snowy patches could be seen on Mt Humphrey. The location is superb for day trips to the Grand Canyon, Williams' Train Depot, Mystic Sedona, Native American ruins, and forest hikes galore. Only 20 minutes to downtown Flagstaff is a historic district of quaint shops with everything from handcrafts to luxury artworks. Our first night we had fish & chips at Collin’s Irish Pub, another night fine dining on linen tablecloths at Josephine’s Bistro. There are several microbreweries all within a walking distance, so pack comfortable shoes. However, you may never want to leave the lodge as it has everything to enjoy a respite in nature, the smell of pines, wildflowers and pond all attract deer, rabbits, birds (from hummingbirds to raptures) no binocular required; they are that close. Chris was an amazing host, friendly, accommodating and informative. He had recommendations to hikes off the beaten path with tips only locals know. An exciting plus for me was actually finding all 13 spices/ingredients right in the cabinet to make traditional Chai tea on the stove! Nothing beats sipping a warm drink from a pottery mug watching sunrise and set sitting on bent willow furniture in the middle of Thundercliffe’s ten acres. We loved it and hope to visit again."

Stayed with kids","We absolutely loved staying here! The photos honestly do NOT do it justice at all. House IS smaller than I thought, but we spent most of our time outside anyway (be it in a screened porch area or the backyard, or out and about), so we didn't mind it at all. The house is much nicer, and the backyard is much nicer than I thought it would be. Staying here made us want to move to the area!
We have a lot of littles, and they enjoyed being downstairs watching movies and running around. The older littles enjoyed going on the kayaks and paddle boards with us. The water in the canals was clear and not too deep until you started getting out into the 'main' canals.
Drive to Tampa takes quite a while, longer than we thought it would. We should have focused almost entirely on more 'local' things to do. You can spend the entire time on the canals and get a great experience, but there's also Weeki Wachee nearby. Food choices are sparse, but there's a grocery store nearby."

The downstairs has lots of room for spreading out, playing games, etc. It's right on the Chaz river where you can see manatees, dolphins, tons of fish, birds, etc. The kayaks and other things are so well maintained - life jackets hung up, boats covered - everything isn't just thrown into a creepy spidery closet willy nilly as you find at some AirBnBs. A lot of care and thought has gone into the guest experience. The only thing I would change would be the mattresses - we found them quite hard and had a hard time getting good sleep. But we would go back in a heartbeat anyway."

Family galore !We needed three more days to get everything. We were traveling with our two sons one is a young adult and the other one is a 17-year-old. This can sometimes prove to be a challenge however, playing ping-pong, cornhole, and pool putting brought us all together. Kayaking to the springs was just beautiful. We saw several manatee.. mom‘s with their babies.. although it was very cold, we still jumped in, truly exhilarating! Kim and Allen‘s communication was the best that I’ve ever seen at an Airbnb. This is probably our 25th. Their response was immediate to some questions we had regarding the TV or to ask for directions. Its not often that you find host that are willing to answer at a moments notice. First class all the way!!! You will not be disappointed! Thanks again we WILL BE BACK!"

You can feel the love they poured into making this home the amazing place that it is. There is so much to do at their place. The kayaks, games, and entertainment available at the home are above and beyond anything we've ever experienced. They keep it in pristine condition and it is absolutely spotless. They sent us a guidebook ahead of check-in with recommendations for entertainment and dining to check out. We needed nothing from them, because their place is literally perfect and they keep plenty of linens, pillows, towels, cleaning supplies and paper good, etc at the house, but they were always quickly responsive to any message we did send ( which was just to gush over their amazing place) and checked in with us during our stay. My only complaint is that we can't stay forever, so we are stuck with the next best thing, which is going back ASAP."

Group trip","Had a great time at Chaz river cottage and everything was above expectation! House was decked out for everything you would want to do on a river as well as all the fun activities you would want to do at the house. We had a steak BBQ on their grill that was perfect. Plenty of games on the 1st floor of the house to play including ping-pong, cornhole, darts and many others as well as a huge 75"" smart TV! They had 8 kayaks for us to enjoy on the river which makes it nice to not have to bring your own kayak. Area was very quiet and peaceful too. My other guests and I kept on being amazed about how fully stocked the house was with appliances/cooking tools/spices/paper goods/towels/blankets/additional air mattress. It was actually more difficult to figure out what they didn't have versus what they did have. Really felt like it was a fully furnished house and we didn't have to buy many things at the store as you would normally have to do at any other AirBnB. Thanks Allen & Kim!!!"

Then we got there it got even better. They had left goodies for us. We didn’t have to run out and get things for breakfast for the next morning.
The bathrooms were completely stocked with shampoo, conditioner etc…..
Having the kayaks right there at the dock was awesome. We could just get up and head down for the docks and off to the springs we go!
Thank you Kim and Allen for making our stay memorable!

The crack was a little hard to find the first time but definitely worth the effort. We ventured out a little further for restaurants. Seafood Seller and the Crab Plant in Crystal River. Pecks in Ozello. Loved sitting on the porch listening to the hoot owls at night.

Stayed with kids","I can not say enough about this home. We visited for a peaceful family vacation on Mother's Day weekend and made so many memories on our trip.
This is a perfect house for families! The bottom floor is overwhelmingly equiped with games and activities for the kids to stay entertained the entire time and they had kayaks and life jackets for the whole crew. The home is clean and stocked with amenities to ensure a comfortable stay. I'm not lying when I say they had everything you could possibly need.
This trip was also a celebration for my husbands birthday and we invited friends and family from the Tampa area over for a bbq and they were all blown away and even asked for the link to book their own trip!
There are so many things to do with the family within a short distance and I would definitely recommend booking your trip for 4+ days. We arrived Thursday and left Sunday morning but I wish I had made the trip for at least two more days to get the full ""river life experience""."

Stayed with kids","I have used Airbnb and similar sites for YEARS, and this was my favorite stay yet! The house was impeccable, and it smelled amazing. We felt at home the minute we walked in. Everything was so thought out, and there was plenty of space. The downstairs offered the perfect hangout spot for the older boys, and the board games kept the younger ones occupied the entire trip. We had planned to drive to different springs in the area, but there was no need. We would eat breakfast, pack lunch, and set out on the kayaks. We traveled by kayak the entire trip! I was nervous at first, but we quickly learned to navigate the waters. Seven sisters spring is so close! We went way too far the first day and passed all the main attractions! Luckily, there were plenty of locals to help us along the way. Someone even gave us a map. (You can get one from the boat launch just past seven sisters). I HIGHLY recommend the crack! It was stunning! This was the perfect local experience with the best hosts!"

We loved having Alexa to play tunes for us. We loved the screened in back porch AND the lower level area with the hanging swings. Awesome place to relax. We didn’t get to take the kayaks out as my friend had a broken foot 🤪 - bummer! Thanks for sharing your space with us."

Stayed over a week","I’ll likely run out of characters before I finish with my compliments. This place and the hosts were perfect. Great place to take your family and enjoy nature. The kayaking and springs are breathtaking. 5 of the kayaks at the house are brand new and very high quality and one is a tandem with 3 additional knock around boats (if you need them). Plenty of wildlife along the river including Manatee, otter, various birds including Bald Eagles. Seven Sisters Spring and the Crack are must sees when you are here. The house is beyond cute and comfortable and a great place for family time after a long paddle. It was just completed remodeled and the attention to detail is amazing. The lower level screen room is the best place to chill or play some games. Great restaurants are within a short drive too. The pictures really don’t do this place justice and the neighbors were wonderful, welcoming people too. Allen and Kim will be the best hosts you’ve ever had with a rental home! Thanks, Ken & Devon 👍"

NOW THE ONLY THING IS THAT THE ROOM ARE TIGHT, NO LARGE DRESSER, MIGHT HAVE TO LIVE OUT OF YOUR SUITE CASE WHILE YOUR THERE. ITS A SMALL PLACE, PICTURE SHOW IT TO BE LARGER. KITCHEN AND DINNING ROOM AND LIVING ROOM ARE LIKE A APPARTMENT STUDIO. BUT BESIDE BEING SMALL PLACE, IT WAS FUN TO STAY IN A CLEAN PLACE. OH YES, YOU ONLY GET ONE PARKING SPOT IN FRONT OF YOUR PLACE, CUZ THERE IS ANOTHER AIRBB NEXT TO YOU. THAT ONE LOOK NICE TO. WELL, ORGANIZED, GREAT HOST.

Rich was very quick to communicate when we had trouble with the internet, but it turned out that the network instructions sent by message were incorrect, which one of us finally figured out. I would also like to add that something really should have been done about the very thick and big ice patch outside the door so no one slips (they had just had a big snowstorm so I'm sure not a problem usually).
I have given it very high ratings because it is really nice, quiet, and has a great little yard. The above comments are meant as suggestions. The beds were big and comfy - a huge plus for us!"

It is extremely dog friendly. The small fenced in yard is amazing for dogs and offers peace of mind to let them roam around. Rich made a convenient blanket for the couch as well to protect the furniture.
Location is convenient! Super close to downtown. 15 min walk to all bars and restaurants or a $5 uber ride if you aren't up for walking.
Kitchen is great! Water temp and pressure in shower is great! WiFi is quick! Heating works amazing to keep you warm on cold nights!
Rich answers super quick if you have any questions.
The mattresses are very firm so if you can't sleep without a pillowy soft mattress, keep that in mind.

Stayed a few nights","Clean and quiet, exactly as it looks in the pictures, and a very straightforward check out process. The shared driveway had a clear line in the middle of the gravel, which I appreciated. Location was great for what we wanted to get done in the area!
The WiFi was slightly spotty, but it may have just been having a bad run of it while I was there—it came back pretty fast during any work calls I had to join, so I stayed off camera and it wasn’t a real hindrance."

Stayed with a pet","This place was beyond great especially for the price. So close to downtown with restaurants only a 4 min drive away. For some reason I thought this was a one bedroom apartment but ended up being a 2 bedroom 2 bath so that was a nice surprise lol. Probably just a lack of reading on my end. The fenced in back yard was great for having my pup. I wish we could have made use of the nice back yard they have here. There was a fire pit, grill and chairs to hang out back there but it rained a lot while we were there so, next time! Highly recommend this home for anyone staying in flagstaff. Thank you, Rich!"

The yard space was clean and good enough for our two dogs for a few days. The beds were very nicely sized and comfortable, as were the large showers. Rich thought of everything from extra doggy bags to clean up after our pups to sandwich baggies and spices in the kitchen. Hours after checking out my son realized he left his beloved stuffed animal up there and Rich found it and mailed it back to us right away. We'll definitely be back!"

Good little rock yard to let our dog go out on. The only reason it didn’t get five stars is I waited 45 minutes to get in due to a glitch getting door code. I tried all ways I could to get in touch with Rich. Almost canceled to go get a hotel when we finally figured out how by doing a deep dive to get the code.

Stayed a few nights","Rich’s Chalet recently completed construction and shares the lot with another of Rich’s lodgings, the Cottage.
Rich is very dedicated to making a stay at The Chalet the very best experience he can offer to guests. He seeks feedback on ideas that would improve a guest’s experience and is appreciative of suggestions.
That said, The Chalet is already a thoroughly comfortable, well appointed, and extremely charming lodging. It is spacious, clean, and features interesting objects for you to consider i.e. a turntable and vinyl records, and more. If Sheri and I could have had a copy version of The Chalet waiting for us at every stop on our road trip we would have been delighted.
We can’t say enough good things about our experience with Rich and The Chalet."

It had a nice fenced space to let the dog out, with a fire ring to enjoy the crisp evenings by. The compact kitchen was well appointed with cooking supplies and even had spices & storage containers - a bonus for us, as we love to cook family-style meals together on vacation. The cozy bedrooms had super-comfy, firm beds. We appreciated the efficient use of space, including the full laundry facilities.

Additionally, any questions we had for the owner were answered within the hour. We would definitely come back to this Airbnb."

We brought our personal golf cart and there was plenty of room for our trailer. The house was just a quick golf cart ride to the little town and convenience store when we needed ice for our coolers. My Two girls did not want to leave. They are already asking to go back. They want to keep exploring and trying to catch small fish from the dock. It was so nice to come home every evening from a day of scalloping to a clean and comfy home away from home. We can't wait to be back next year!

We were in the area to see the manatee and were NOT disappointed. Went to Three Sisters Springs and saw TONS. Plus the beautiful trails and water. Downtown Crystal River had nice restaurants and shops.
Took the 1 1/2 hour car ride to Clearwater Beach- VERY crowded. Also went to Tarpon Springs- fun Greek town which makes you feel like you stepped into the movie MY BIF FAT GREEK WEDDING.
Overall plenty to do right around this area.
We enjoyed our time and this tiny home.

Although tiny, the home had much to offer and space where you needed it. The shower was roomy and the bathroom had enough space. Because of good organization, a lot was able to fit in the small kitchen. As my husband said “this place must’ve been designed by a genius“. There is a nice seating area outside and it was fun to have morning coffee there and chat with the people walking their dogs going by. Even though it is an RV park and the units are close to each other, there was plenty of privacy, and the neighbors were extremely friendly. It was also very quiet, despite being near a busy road and next-door to the camp host who is friendly and helpful. Thanks Erich"

Stayed a few nights","The house was perfect for a short stay. The key was an absolute nightmare to deal with. Every time we had to use it, it would get stuck. The only thing I would change would have not having white everything. We were in constant panic of our muddy shoes, makeup etc staining. Also having instructions on how to use the washer/dryer combo would have helped tremendously. We had to leave with wet clothes and spent over 4 hours trying to figure out how to use it. Other then that the hosts were very responsive, the place was well stocked when most air bnb’s give the bare minimum. The bedding was great quality and we were extremely surprised with how powerful the water pressure was. We would definitely stay here again."

Stayed one night",Very cute place with everything that you'll need for a short stay. I was impressed by the amenities (there is even a clothes washer and surprised to see room for 5 to sleep (2x double beds + a single couch/bed). Note that this is in an RV park so there are other RVs very close to the house. I would recommend this to others.

It has everything you need to relax for a few days. We really wanted to go to this area to experience the varied nature of Florida. The location of the Tiny House is perfect for this!
Communication with Erich went smoothly and was always friendly and helpful.
We had a good time 😊"

Stayed with a pet",Very cute tiny house. Looked exactly how it was listed. Great location. Responsive host. Beautifully decorated. Comfortable bed. Pet friendly. The only things I did not like was the futon in living room was too narrow to sit comfortably & maybe put some mini blinds in the lofts so you can actually sleep in to avoid that sunlight. Very satisfied with my stay.

Stayed with a pet","Very cute tiny house inside. Couch is not very comfy to do some tv lounging, so wish it raised to the bed level. RV park is extremely quiet and seems more residential. I felt safe being located right between the grounds keeper and maintenance guy. Unfortunately the dog park was overgrown and not usable and there was no bonfire. Location is convenient off the main road and a short drive to Homosassa restaurants/park as well as Chaz River area."

This home had everything we needed for a short getaway and was beautiful! The details were perfect, and made us feel like home… Well almost. Lol Not a good choice if you don’t like stairs. The park was quiet, peaceful, and easy to get to. Bob the maintenance professional was awesome and so friendly. We’ll definitely stay here again."
