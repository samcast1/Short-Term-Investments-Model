Stayed with kids",Wonderful experience. This was my family Christmas. Shannon had a tree decorated and the place just felt warm. We invited my dad and stepmom and they were just blown away at how beautiful the place was. We all had a bed room to sleep in with comfy beds. We totally enjoyed our stay. One of best Christmases ever. We will probably be doing this again next year. Thank you Shannon for being a wonderful host. Merry Christmas!

Group trip","This is the first time my family went through Airbnb for a place to stay, when traveling and Bryan made the process very easy for us. When there was a scheduling issue, he upgraded us to another property nearby that was actually bigger and more private for no additional cost. The place was beautiful inside and out and was the perfect accommodation for my family as we attended a family reunion in the area. We would definitely stay again."

Stayed over a week","Just as pictured and on a nice, quiet street with a pretty backyard view. Couch and beds were comfortable. Streaming TVs in each room were a nice amenity and wi-fi had high speeds and bandwidth for streaming and working remotely. Kitchen and laundry appliances, water heater, and HVAC all worked great. (Be aware that a toaster is not included in the kitchen amenities, but it has pretty much everything else you would need!) We had a couple things come up and Bryan was always very quick to respond - super helpful and accommodating!"

The beds are very comfortable and the bedding is luxurious and beautiful. Bryan helped us get into the house, brought us a table and some chairs for a dinner party, and called us at our request when we had a need. The parking pad, covered, is good to have. It's a great place. We'll stay at Bryan's homes again, for sure."

Stayed with kids","Bryan went above & beyond for our stay! We were in town to arrange and host our father’s funeral. We reached out last minute (same day) hoping that we would get a response because he was the only AirBNB in the area! Within just moments he responded! Once we arrived, we were completely blown away by the kindness from a “complete stranger” who went above and beyond to express condolences for our loss! I reached out to Bryan for assistance with the Wifi password & an issue with the Hot Water; he walked me through the Wi-Fi and literally within 30 minutes had the hot water issue fixed. (It was simply a safety feature that needed adjusting!)
We were so beyond grateful for our stay in this house & will ensure that any area we travel, we will check to see if he has an available home before booking anywhere else! Thank you, Bryan!"

Stayed one night","This was a solo trip for me, just to get away for a night. I was going to arrive a little later than I had originally planned but I communicated that before my trip. Mr. Bill had already sent me instructions on how to get inside, but I caught him before he left for the evening. He took the time to show me around and make sure I was set for the night. It was so nice to be in the country and see some of God's beauty. I walked the vineyard and watched the sunset since it was such a beautiful night. The next morning, Mr. Bill had a delicious breakfast waiting for me: blueberry pancakes, eggs, bacon and some of the best strawberries Ive ever had. He and I had good conversation and I learned new things in the process. Overall, I couldn't be more pleased with my stay and will for sure be back for another visit."

Stayed one night","We have visited White Squirrel Winery five times now, and each time is more and more enjoyable! It is always a pleasure to stop in on our winter trip south and visit with Bill Sanderson, owner. He is a superb host, and his wine is awesome. We purchased five different types of wine to take with us, including his 2023 new award-winning Chardonel. In addition, we stocked up on Marjie’s exclusive, homemade soaps.
The sunset and sunrise over this beautiful Tennessee winery are breathtaking from the cozy loft suite that has always been comfortable and clean. Bill is a true, southern host, great breakfast chef, and good teacher of his grapes and wine making. We consider him a friend and feel almost as if we are “coming home“ each time we arrive. We are considering a fall trip this year just to visit WSW and take in the countryside.
If you were looking for a unique place to stay and love, Wine, we highly recommend WSW and their sweet barn loft suite."

During the tasting Bill answered all of our questions and taught us the history behind some of the wines and the meanings of their names. Every morning we were greeted with a conversation and some of the best homemade food we could ask for. The fresh blueberry pancakes were top of the list with the homemade hashbrowns taking a close second. Bill's knowledge of the area and where the best restaurants and activities were made our planning for the day really simple."

The only negative feedback I would give is that we were unaware there would be an event going on into the evening. We understand this was an active winery that hosts events but we weren't notified of there being an event until we showed up.
All in all it was still a great stay, we would just recommend notifying guests ahead of time."

Stayed one night","White Squirrel Winery and Vineyard is a genuine jewel hidden in the little town of Kenton. Being there was like inhaling a peace and beauty we longed for.
Bill greeted us with a warm smile and took us to our immaculately charming loft.
Hours after we arrived we had a couples massage that was the epitome of relaxation.
We decided to sleep late and skip breakfast.But Bill being an impeccable host, still left us breakfast on the patio.
Most people would have left us a continental breakfast but that’s most people.
We sat down to fluffy blueberry pancakes, seasoned eggs, crispy bacon and melon. It was delicious!
Oh!! Did I tell you what I woke up to? When I opened my window to take in the view I heard the melodious voice of Nat King Cole singing”When I Fall in Love”. I was done for the day!!!
Bill also told us earlier there were apple trees so we could pick a bag if we liked. Can you say romance????
Chuck and I had a romantic anniversary that we will remember for years to come !"

Definitely what we were looking for to recharge. The place was very clean, modern, had everything we needed to feel at home. This lovely space was beautiful (lots of lovely touches).
We had a great time at Bills And Marjie's place. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does in the pictures. Bill was such a great host. We had wine tasting experience. Had a wonderful breakfast in the morning. Also, took some fresh apples from the farm back home. The wine was amazing, we had to take 1/2 a case on the go. We are looking forward to staying here again one day."

Stayed a few nights","Bill and Marjie were exceptional hosts! We thoroughly enjoyed the wine tasting and breakfast provided by Bill. Their attention to detail was outstanding from the fresh flowers, to the restaurant recommendations everything was perfection. The vineyards were in full bloom and provided a leisurely morning stroll. We enjoyed sitting on the porch reading and taking in the beauty of the location, and the gorgeous sunsets. I hope to visit again and will recommend White Squirrel Winery to anyone needing a nice getaway."

Stayed one night","Marjie, greets us at the front door of the Winery had freshly cut flowers in our loft. Bill recommend a fabulous restaurant in Obion TN. The prime rib was fantastic, gave us a free dessert coupon. The beautiful sunrise looking over the vineyard was amazing to say the least. Wow this couple really know how to make you feel special. Cheif Bill made wonderful blueberry pancakes, eggs and bacon. Coffee made by his lovely wife all served at 9am Sunday morning. Very pleased with our stay, will visit again very soon, I absolutely love nature and enjoyed waking up to such an incredible view at The White Squirrel 🐿️. Thanks so much for your kindness and making us feel at home 🏡"

The southern breakfast was DELICIOUS and so is the wine! Bill was very welcoming and knowledgeable about the area and the state, and his recommendations made our stay and continued road trip even better!
I can only recommend to stay here very much for a getaway break or a stop during a trip."

Bill and Marjie were great hosts. We learned a lot about grapes and making of wine as well as what to do in the area. Bill can be your best friend instantly. He is so friendly and made us feel at home. Marjie makes candles and soaps so in addition to buying wine we also bought her products. We will definitely will be back for a visit and looking forward to staying longer. Thanks for a wonderful time.

You start the day with a homemade breakfast that is second to none made by Bill. The location is great and there are several attractions close by. Would highly recommend.

Marjie was there to capture our special moment. The suite is exactly as described and is as beautiful as the photos. We saw a squirrel and a bunny playing together from our window. Also saw a eagle flying on the property. Bill cooked us an amazing breakfast… and we enjoyed our morning talk with him. Make sure that you pick up some of Marjie’s soap and candles along with wine before you head out! This place will always hold a special piece of my heart. We will definitely come back :)"

Our visit started with a welcome from the host and a tour of the winery, bottle of wine included. Bill recommended local places to eat for dinner and filled us in on the history of the winery. Later that evening, we enjoyed an amazing firefly show over the vineyard from the room!
The next morning, right on our agreed upon time, Bill arrived at the winery and turned on the 1920s jazz music welcoming us to our homemade breakfast, complete with blueberry pancakes and local fresh strawberries. Afterward, we enjoyed a stroll through the vineyard.
We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and plan to return in the future. If you're looking for an experience to remember, this is worth the drive for sure!"

Stayed one night","Our night's stay at the White Squirrel Winery was a perfect getaway from the city. Bill & Marjie were wonderful hosts. There was an outdoor event going on as we arrived with draft beer, live music, and a food truck. The crowd was very friendly, and the vibe was relaxed. It wrapped up on the early side so we had a very peaceful evening. The room was cozy, the bed was comfortable, and the large claw-foot tub was great for relaxing.
We were given a free bottle of wine with our stay, and were treated to a delicious home-cooked breakfast. We lean toward drier wines, and the Rose and Cab were both very good, and we took a bottle of the Norton and Chambourcin home with us to try. We were free to walk the grounds, but it was a little early in the season for vine growth, so we will definitely be coming back when the vineyard is on full display."

They have a great selection of wines ranging from the dry reds to the sweeter whites. This year’s Cabernet is excellent! Bill produces the grapes on-site in a beautifully manicured 90 acre vineyard. The barnloft Airbnb provides the perfect place for a romantic getaway. The breakfast that Bill cooks up each morning is second to none. The most memorable part of the experience is the fun conversations provided by Bill and Marjie along with the local friends that stop by. When we arrive, we feel welcomed by good friends.

The walls of the stairs leading up to the loft were lined with WSW history. We enjoyed reading those & seeing how far it’s come. The place is decorated beautifully. It’s not too much and there are little treasures all through out that allow you to get to know your hosts more. My husband & I spent a good chunk of time smelling all of the candles & soaps. Marjie does a great job. We couldn’t wait to enjoy the new soap we purchased so we took a nice long bath in the claw foot tub.
The view from the room is breathtaking. We had the big window open anytime we could. We enjoyed a fire under the pavilion with its beautifully hung lights. We had a great tasting breakfast when we woke up. The table was set beautifully. The food was seasoned just right. All of it was so dreamy & romantic.
We adored WSW & can not wait to be back. We created so many memories in such a short amount of time. We are very thankful for this space."

Stayed one night","If you are looking for a cool place to stay with a lot of varied opportunities near by, then this is one of the best AIRBNB locations that we have stayed at to date. The loft is really nice and cozy, with amazing views of the vineyard and the winery. The drive to get there was amazing, and we came from almost all the possible directions, due to our Geocaching trip. You are close to Reelfoot Lake, The Mississippi River, Discovery Park, the B17 crash site and Memorial, Rural King and Trimble TN. If you don't know what is in Trimble, you need to go there on one of your day trips from the White Squirrel, they have moonshine and beer. The host was amazing and told us about several of the locations and about his farm and the grapes and wine. We enjoyed our complimentary bottle of wine and slept like a baby. We woke the next morning to a great breakfast that was impossible to consume due to the size of the portion. The eggs and Blueberry pancakes were perfect. My only regret was that we had to leave."

With amazing suggestions/recommendations on surrounding activities & venues to explore to assisting us in locating a restaurant just right for our dinner Friday night (even providing us with a coupon).
Wine is incredible not to mention the gorgeous tranquil setting of the venue & grounds. The airbnb is absolutely charming! From the lovely comfortable murphy bed to the super relaxing clawfoot tub, we felt pampered to the max. They even provided a complimentary bottle of wine with our stay. Being allowed to explore the vineyard/grounds & enjoying a private evening on the patio with views of the ponds under a star filled nighttime sky was so special.
Breakfast the next morning was delicious, served to us in the winery. Bacon, eggs, fresh blueberry pancakes, honeydew melon served with coffee & grape juice made directly on the premises was to die for. Can't say thank you enough for everything. Anyone wanting to just have a peaceful, relaxing rest should put this location on their wishlist. We will definitely return.
BTW: Margie, Bill's wife, makes the most wonderful soaps. Be sure to treat yourself with a bar when you sink into that glorious clawfoot tub.
Also a special shoutout to Tina for an incredible wine tasting on Sat."

Stayed one night","This was for sure the best experience I’ve ever had with Airbnb. Bill is the best host and his place is just impeccable!
Since there is only one bedroom, this is an exclusive experience which makes it even more special. My husband and I arrived mid afternoon and since minute one, Bill was very warm and welcoming.
Since it’s my husband’s birthday weekend, Bill helped me to arrange a massage in our room for my husband. I didn’t have to worry about anything.
We tasted his wine, which is for sure one of the best I’ve ever had in my life - my husband agrees with me. The views of his farm are beautiful. It’s such a peaceful place. We enjoyed very much to taste some delicious wine just sitting outside with those views and the fresh breeze.
The bedroom suite is so adorable and cozy! The views are also beautiful (including at night, when you can see the moon from one of the windows).
The bathtub is another great and romantic detail that we loved!
Bill took us on a tour through his property and explained a lot to us, it was amazing to learn more about farming and the amazing work he does in his farm.
The breakfast cooked by Bill was another big hit! Everything so fresh and delicious! His grape juice is the best I’ve ever had. The pancakes with blueberries from his plantation are spectacular!
I have literally zero complaints! It’s the type of experience that recharges your energy and fulfills the soul.
We left his property with lots of delicious wines, looking forward to be part of his wine club and we will definitely go back soon!"

The room is a super cute loft with a big tub (no standing shower, but the tub has a sprayer!) with a view of the winery from above. Breakfast was amazing, the wine is awesome, and the host was great! We will definitely be returning during the summer when the vineyard is in full swing!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a fantastic place to stay. The hosts are very accommodating and friendly. They immediately made us feel at home. For those that want to be in the middle of the action, this location may not be for you. There is a good amount to see and do in the area, but you will have a 30+ minute drive to get to most things. This did not take away at all from our experience. We knew it was a more rural area, which was what we were looking for in a long weekend. They have some really good selections at the winery (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic). Breakfast was very, very good, too. We highly recommend you look up Bill and Marjie for your next West Tennessee adventure!!"

Bill was such a gracious hosts greeting us with a hot and delicious breakfast each morning and loads of recommendations for sights to see and excellent food choices to try. We were a little wary of spending our fall break in a small town that we had never heard of before. If you're thinking the same, then you have nothing to worry about. The vineyard is located a nice drive from all sorts of different activities. We enjoyed the nearby lake, biking and hiking trails, Discovery Park, plus the vineyard itself and wine tasting! Overall, wonderful stay and would gladly recommend to others!"

Breakfast was provided which was convenient as the area is rural and Bill was great for conversation and a wealth of information of grapes!

Stayed a few nights","White Squirrel Winery was the best find we have experienced in a while. My husband and I travel a lot, not only out of the country, but to small towns in our great state of Tennessee. Bill started us off with a wine tasting; he has a wealth of knowledge about growing the grapes as well as all that goes in to bottling the wine. The wine is by far the best I have ever had from a small winery, with a wide variety to choose from.
The room we rented was cozy, clean and up to date; the view from the window was beautiful. Along with the rental you will receive a scrumptious breakfast made farm fresh. We even mentioned to Bill he made the best eggs we've ever eaten! The conversation flows naturally with Bill and Marjie as their hospitality is second to none.
We cannot wait to return in September to see the orchard full of grapes!"

Stayed one night","Choosing to stay at the Romantic Winery Loft over the White Squirrel Winery was the best choice we made during our winter get-a-way. Not only was the loft over the winery creative and unique, it was very comfy and clean. Bill & Marjie made sure we had more than just what was needed for a relaxing stay. They thought of everything and then some. Breakfast, made by Bill, the following morning was absolutely delicious. However, I have to say that the thing we enjoyed most was tasting the great dry wines from the winery and visiting with the local neighbors and friends. This is obviously a popular place for the locals, who were very friendly and welcomed passersbys. We had a terrific time and look forward to going back for more than one night. If you have the opportunity to stay in the loft, or just stop for wine, you will not be disappointed."

Bill really educated me on grapes and wines and the care they put into them shows in the quality. The wines are fantastic! Marjie makes all the soaps and candles and I brought several home for myself and gifts.

They were so welcoming when we got there, bill showed us around told us about the area and gave us some suggestions on where to eat. The winery was open on our first day there so we sat downstairs and tried the Jive wine which we FELL in love with, and enjoyed the atmosphere. The loft is the cutest place, you get a wonderful view of the winery and outside. Bed was great, TV was nice since we were there on New Year’s Eve we watched the ball drop and drank our complementary wine! Couldn’t have asked for a better way to start 2021. If you are even thinking about staying here do it, bill will even make you breakfast which is so sweet. These are real people running a wonderful place. I can’t wait to visit again."

This is very secluded which we loved so if you are looking for close restaurants or shopping it’s about 25 minutes to that. We enjoyed the stars and large yard with beautiful fire pit. Felt very at home and relaxing

Cozy with plush couches and beds, the layout offered privacy and space. The kitchen felt like home, equipped with all the necessities. Rustic touches added allure, blending perfectly with the serene surroundings.
The view was breathtaking, whether admiring the majestic trees, cornfields or relaxing in the backyard under the string lights. Reconnecting with nature, enchanted by birdsongs and starry nights, left a transformative mark on all of us.
Kudos to our gracious host for enhancing our stay with warmth and care. She was also responsive quickly.
Our time here was sheer enchantment, crafting cherished memories and reminding us of simplicity’s beauty. For a serene escape, this hidden gem is unparalleled."

Stayed with a pet","we had a wonderful family gathering at this place. the fire pit was frequently used, the very long table in the dining room was great for games and meals together. kitchen was large and well stocked. Game room was a good time as well, large enough for us all to congregate and play darts.
Thought the house was a little closer to the lake, ended up being 30 min drive. However, the drive was pretty and we had no big issues navigating there and back for dinner and hikes or fishing.
There was a washer and dryer, though we could not find the laundry soap, and so any messes or child accidents were hand washed. minor setback, nothing major.
house was clean, lots of towels and utensils, and we had plenty of space.
thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","The cabin is gorgeous! It is very private and quiet. My husband and I wanted a relaxing weekend to get away from it all and this was perfect! The cabin is super cozy and newly remodeled. 2 full bathrooms and plenty of room for a bigger family/group. Beds were neatly made and sheets super soft and clean! Kitchen has everything u might need to cook i.e- spices,pots,pans,casserole dishes,cast iron skillets,silverware,steak knives,etc. For the coffee lovers,they have a Bunn restaurant style coffee maker! IYKYK! The cabin has a brand new dishwasher as well if u want to go that route. We had such an amazing peaceful time. The fire pit was a great place to relax,star gaze and watch lightening bugs. They have lights streamed along the back tree line for subtle light which was perfect. Plenty of firewood to keep the fire going for days! There is a nice big game room in one of the buildings on the property. Would be great for family time. We only stayed 2 nights and didn’t get to enjoy it ourselves,so we will do that next time! This cabin has a 2 car garage as well if u wanted to park inside. We didn’t use it for that as we felt it wasn’t necessary. This cabin is out by itself (except for the nice owners out back on their own property) so it’s very safe and no neighbors to worry about. Streaming the TV was great and we had no issues. Kroger in Dyersburg is 15 mins the back roads. So if ur coming there and don’t want to have to run back out,stop by the grocery store before hand and grab ur goodies! S’mores will be on my next list on the next trip there. Washer/dryer was a blessing! So if ur wanting peace and quiet and to have a blast with ur friends or family,then book this cabin now! U won’t be disappointed!! 10/10"

Then a weather emergency came up. We were so worried as we'd lost a car 6 months ago to a Texas hail storm. But soon as Dan and Lane got our call, they didn’t hesitate to rescue us, going above and beyond to shelter our car from looming hail. We are so very grateful to them. Can't adequately express my gratitude for their willingness to help us."

Cooking in the well stocked kitchen while looking out the sink window was relaxing. The wooden floors throughout add charming warmth. The king sized bed was comfortable. The full sized washer and dryer were clean and well functioning. A well organized notebook contained answers to almost any question you might have from WIFI passwords to operational manuals for all appliances to items of local interest and local history. The whole property was clean and well cared for both inside and out. The vast display of stars at night kept you staring up long into the night. Dan and Lane are excellent hosts and their property is a real treasure. I hope there’s an opening the next time we come through western TN, because we will want to stay there again."

Turns out we very much preferred staying 20 minutes away in Dan and Lane's house in the country. The kitchen is equipped the best I’ve seen in an airbnb. The house is spacious and decor is modern a nd updated. Loved the wood flooring, the bathrooms, the breakfast table, the comfortable TV chairs in the living room, the bar where we put the computer and were able to carry on with stuff waiting for us to do once we got home. Will gladly stay there again!"

Stayed over a week","My stay in Bradford was full of fun twist and turns that we’re made into great memories. I stayed there as a student for 12 weeks while on a rotation for school in Martin, which is about 30 min away. Bradford is small, but you are 45min from Jackson and 30 minutes from a great winery in Humbolt. You are also only 10 min from Greenfield which has some super cute local restaurants. Living alone in this cabin I felt extremely safe and enjoyed the beauty and peace and quiet of the West Tennessee country life. The cabin has a wide variety of cooking tools, spices, and pretty much everything you need for a stay. Dan and Lane are close if you need anything and they are great about responding. They made sure I was always taken care of. If I needed anything at all they were always there to help. I would recommend this place for a student or even just a weekend escape to the country side."

The farmhouse is situated in a quiet part of the countryside and has a large porch with a beautiful backyard. The area feels safe and the surrounding outdoors are very peaceful! The farmhouse itself was the perfect size and Dan and Lane have it stocked to the gills with amenities. The internet works great if you need it for school or work! Dan and Lane are extremely fast to respond to any needs or questions you might have! Driving to Milan, TN was a fun and daily adventure for us (about 15 minutes away) where there is a beautiful park, a Walmart, and some great food options. I can’t recommend this Air BnB location enough! If you book with Dan and Lane you will NOT regret it!"

Dan and Lane were extremely nice and very attentive. They checked in on me and made sure I was doing well and that I was never in need of anything. They live near by and if you ever need them to come by to check on something, they are able to do so quickly. Great place, great hosts. If I am ever in the area again, would stay here."

Quiet mornings or early evenings spent on the back porch listening to the birds chirp and the bugs hum are the very definition of Tennessee tranquility. They have gone to great lengths to provide southern hospitality, with many thoughtful touches throughout their cozy home - especially in the kitchen with more than the basic essentials like oil, pans, spices, etc."

Stayed with kids","Dan and Lane's place was great and was exactly as described and as pictured. It is very spacious and has everything you could possibly need for your getaway. The kitchen is fully stocked with cookware and utensils, including an electric skillet, and there is a propane grill for your cookouts. The bed in the master bedroom was very comfortable, and the wi-fi worked perfectly for my remote work during our stay, as well as to stream some TV shows at night. Dan and Lane are wonderful hosts; they are extremely kind, welcoming and hospitable. They graciously agreed to let us check in early after we drove overnight. They also allowed us to use the above-ground pool on their property, which our 22-month-old daughter loved. They were also very quick to answer any questions or assist with any issues, and they were kind enough to sit and have a conversation with us. Dan and Lane have thought of every detail in their house, including k-cups for the Keurig, bottles of water in the fridge upon our arrival, and extra toothbrushes and toothpaste should you forget yours.
The location, while rural and somewhat remote, is within easy driving distance of a couple of different Wal-Marts, and Jackson, TN, is only about 40 minutes away and has most of the major stores and fast food restaurants. The location was also very much a plus for us, as we were looking to get away from the hustle and bustle and enjoy some peace and quiet. The area around the house is very quiet, and when we went out on the deck at night, all we could hear were the crickets.
I honestly can't recommend Dan and Lane's place enough, whether you are just looking for a quiet, socially distanced getaway during COVID or looking for a place to stay for work, you really can't go wrong. We are already planning our return visit."

Stayed a few nights","Dan was a good communicator and made the check-in process easy.
However, the sleeping arrangements should have been more accurately described -- if you're a couple sharing a bed, it's fine, but the second bed is virtually a cot and not appropriate or comfortable for another adult. Also, there was a distinct, prevalent sewer smell that did not dissipate by opening windows. The two guests were both licensed plumbers and knew what needed to be done to remedy the problem, but the only advice forthcoming was to open the windows. We felt that the photos and description were misleading. Dan agreed to alter them after I brought them to his attention. We would not return."

Upon checking in, Dan showed us around his house which is gorgeous and has a wrap-around veranda. In the morning, we enjoyed our coffee and watched the hummingbirds on the porch. Dan even made us breakfast on the last morning of our stay. If you are ever in the Bradford area, you should definitely stay here."

This was a business trip which had to be rescheduled multiple times over many months. Shannon was very gracious and flexible when we would need to reschedule.

Although we didn't use the screened-in porch, it would provide plenty of seating for a large group to hang out.

Joseph was accommodating and responsive. We asked to set up a toddler pool and he was very quick to respond with a yes! The home is on the highway but it was a total non issue, we couldn’t hear anything in the house and the yard was large so we didn’t have to worry about the kids being close to the road. We would definitely stay in the future."

Stayed a few nights","Joseph's mobile home was a very short drive from Reelfoot Lake State Park. It was clean and comfortable, and had everything we needed. The mattresses weren't great, but they sufficed. There was a covered parking space; a big, well-equipped kitchen; a comfortable eating area; and a spacious living room. There were laundry facilities available, and there was a deck for summertime use. The decor was very 'thematic' (LOL): perfect for avid hunters and fishermen. We have no complaints at all about our stay, and appreciated Joseph's courtesy and quick answers to our questions. I would recommend this place, especially to a big group of people looking for accommodations while fishing in the area, or anyone wanting to visit Reelfoot Lake SP."

Stayed a few nights","There were pros and cons to our stay- pros were house was super clean and very tidy. The backyard had amazing sunset views. The master bed was firm and comfortable. We did not use the other bedrooms. Kitchen had plenty of room to cook and plenty of plates,glasses,and silverware. Having the washer and dryer was a huge plus!
Cons- 2 neighbors had very loud vehicles which they started quite frequently during our stay. The front of the house is right at the road (master bedroom and living room side) so if ur a light sleeper this could be an issue. Both showers had mold coming out of the surround walls where the seam meets the tub. The shower floor in the main bathroom was super soft and squishy. The pillows in the master bedroom are thin,and stained. I am not sure the owners are aware of these things,but if they were addressed this would be a super great place to stay. I still gave 4 stars bcuz it so cosmetically clean!"

It’s located in a quiet neighborhood and not far from any restaurants or shops. I will definitely be booking again, thank you Lisa for sharing your beautiful space."

Two points to the potential guest - there is no door on the bedroom, and the door to the bathroom (sliding) doesn't totally cover the opening. My kids would yell, ""I'm going to the bathroom, no one go to the hallway"" to make sure they had privacy."

The master bed was extremely comfortable, and the pillows were perfect.

I’m very happy we found Lisa’s place because there was no way I could’ve done the 19 hour drive from Imlay City,MI to our home in Dallas TX with 4 kids. The home is located walking distance to a gas station with really good Bar B Que 😋 Overall, we enjoyed Lisa’s place. Thank you Lisa!"

Lisa was easy to reach and informed us that the roku was messed up and that she would replace it. We told her it wasn't necessary, we would be fine without it. She had it replaced before we arrived. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay even though we weren't there long. If my daughter decides to attend UT Martin we will most definitely be back."

Its a shame because it is such a cute adorable house, but I could never stay there again due to the unhealthy environment. Im not sure if these types of rentals are inspected but they sure need to be before they are allowed to be rented."

Stayed with kids","This was more cost effective for our family of six than renting two hotel rooms close to Discovery Park. It’s a good 20-30 minutes away but it was beautiful countryside to see.
The house is like stepping back into a time warp and the golf cart made this such a fun place for our kids (and husband). Bring bug spray!
Pros: communication with Jan via text was easy and quick, full kitchen to cook breakfast, stocked bathrooms, welcome info book was very helpful and thorough, washer/dryer worked well and came with detergent, one of the fuses blew after I tried to blow dry my hair but Bill came over and fixed it quickly, kids enjoyed the swing outside
Cons: one bedroom for our kids felt very far away from the master and it was on the front of the house so we double checked the front door was bolted, recommend white noise or a fan because there was a rhythmic thumping sound at night (might have been nuts hitting the roof but it sounded more like pipes to me), had trouble streaming Netflix on the tv but got Disney Plus to work - it is nice to unplug but an option to watch a movie at night is what we needed after a full day, maybe add DVD player? Like all old houses, lighting was dim.
Definitely plan for 2 days at Discovery Park and check out the drive thru Safari while you’re near! Central location and good place to stay for a quick visit."

While the home is older and hearkens back to yesteryear, it is none the less equipped with all the modern conveniences and niceties. We were immediately struck by the quietness, peacefulness and serenity of the property…we immediately felt at home. When not indoors, the patio offers a very nice place to sit out and visit, while enjoying the outdoors and listening to all the sounds of nature. We also enjoyed the gnome trail while out riding the golf cart, which was a fun and interesting touch to enjoy while touring the property. Additionally, we picked a few of the pears off the tree to eat right there, while sitting on the bench by the pond…wow, talk about being inundated by childhood memories!
Even though we only live about 2.5 hours away, this little piece of Heaven is a world of difference!
Thanks Jan and Bill! You guys are great hosts!

Stayed with kids","Miss Martha's was exactly what we needed. It was a great place to get away, yet it felt like home. The house was extremely clean. We loved that our family of 5 had plenty of space to stretch out, but also plenty of room to be together as well. My girls adored the swing in the back and my son loved driving the golf cart. My husband and I loved that it was a working farm! The property is beyond belief! It is absolutely beautiful. it is close enough to various towns, if you need anything. There were plenty of towels and plenty amenities. We didn't need to ask for anything, because it was already there and labeled. We hope to return soon to see family again, and when we do we want to stay at Miss Martha's again."

Morning rides on the golf cart with coffee was just like being at home! Our daughter and her friend loved LuLu and had plenty of space to explore inside and outdoors.
What a quaint, beautiful home.
Wish we could have stayed longer and grilled out dinner together.
Thank you so much for your hospitality!"

Stayed with kids",Don’t miss the opportunity to spend some time unwinding at Miss Martha’s! You will not be disappointed. Jan and Bill have paid attention to every detail possible to ensure a memorable visit. The home is spacious and inviting and very clean. The outdoor living space is comfortable and the farm is beautiful and can be enjoyed via the golf cart provided by the owners. The fish were biting morning and evening in the pond just walking distance from the back door of the house. The location of Miss Martha’s was far enough from civilization but still close enough to town to enjoy local shopping and dining as well as Reelfoot Lake and The Discovery Park of America. We will be sure to visit Miss Martha’s again!

Stayed with kids","Stayed at Jan and Bill’s place 07/31-08/02/2020 and loved every minute. The home and land is beautiful. There was plenty of space for our 2 families (4 adults and 4 small children) to stay there comfortably. We spent most of our time outside enjoying their beautiful land. Our kids loved the golf cart, fishing and the paddle boat. The Adventure Park of America is close to their home and we highly recommend spending a day (or two) there. Our stay was peaceful and just what our families needed. Thank you Jan and Bill!"

Now, Bill, he was absolutely amazing! He gave us great welcome. He helped us fishing and getting the Golf cart going.
This was just the beginning of the great experience we had have.
Kids loved the house that offered endless possibilities to hide and play at. There was ample amount of space to accommodate another whole family. We are 2+3.
Outside it was heaven for kids to liberate some extra energy and get them ready for bad.
Thanks so much for making it memory maker!!

We came to visit the area for our son's baseball tournament and were extremely glad that chose to stay here versus a hotel in town. There was so much room for the kids and much more to do! We would highly recommend staying with Jan and Bill if you are coming to this area. It was very noticeable how much personal pride they take into the property and for making our stay a memorable one."

Stayed a few nights","If you are looking to get away, enjoy some beautiful Tennessee scenery and meet a couple of kind, extraordinary hosts -- then this could be the place for you. Miss Martha's is off-the-beaten-path, but it is an easy drive on paved roads. Miss Martha's is so very comfortable and I immediately felt at home.
The hosts are extremely thoughtful & very attentive to the small details. Miss Martha's is well-stocked with coffee, bottled water & wonderful English muffins for breakfast. The home was extremely clean and ready for my arrival.
Regular communications were initiated by the hosts prior to arrival to assist in my travels and locating the home. Check-in information and assistance was provided ahead of time to accommodate easy access/check-in.
Jan, Bill & Lulu (their sweet Corgie) stopped by to welcome me to Miss Martha's and assure that I had everything needed. I shared with them that I was in the area to work on some of my family genealogy research. They were able to provide information, stories and resource suggestions. We figured out that we share some family-lines (through marriage). As a genealogist -- this was so very exciting and a highlight of my time in Tennessee.
Miss Martha's is a perfect place to find peace, rest, and quiet time. You can hear the wind blow and the many voices of the small birds that sing. There is no wi-fi, but phone service was strong (I have AT&T) -- if you have a need to connect.
At Miss Martha's you will definitely meet new friends -- and who knows -- maybe you'll even find a new family connection like me.
I highly recommend this wonderful home. I do hope to return and stay longer!"

The rolling hills of wheat and corn along with the gorgeous fishing pond, various trees, and barn were breath taking. We took a nightly ride on the golf cart across the property and caught 10 nice size fish (bass and blue gill...we threw back). The house is so cozy...love the sunroom and all the nostalgic decorations. So much love put into this home. We saw deer, rabbits, hummingbirds...even from the back porch one morning! We enjoyed the coloring books, games and piano...I was able to dust off my old piano skills and teach the kids some songs. Just a perfect place to unwind and reconnect with family and nature. We came for Discovery Park, but the sweetest memories were from Miss Martha's. Jan and Bill are fabulous...Jan even made a cookie cake for our son's bday! And there was snacks and water too. We can't wait to return!"

Stayed a few nights","The place was spotless with tons of room. Kitchen well-stocked and plenty of towels in the bathroom. Location ok—in the middle of a neighborhood which was fine but I felt somewhat exposed with no blinds over the doors when I was in the main living area. I had a little trouble getting the lock to work to get in but Bryan did eventually call me back and tell me the trick to get in. Overall good stay. In the end, CLEAN and comfortable is what matters most to me."

Stayed with kids","Kids enjoyed a tv in every bedroom and the partially fenced in backyard surrounded by tree. They liked the basket of toys in the room with the bunk beds. We enjoyed the safe and quiet neighborhood. Very quiet! The stocked coffee and cups laid out for us, and a uncluttered very clean home. We didn’t like the scratched up
frying pan . We liked the host. Very responsive and helpful."

The beds were comfy and tvs in every room. Love the number lock so we didn’t have to keep up with a key! Will definitely be staying here again next year

I have Ambassador elite status at the Marriott so I typically stay at a hotel, but after this experience I'm reconsidering ever staying at a hotel again for long stays. the place is very nice, Right of Lake Road were all the eateries are located. There was plenty of space and it was very clean. I wasn't really sure about the clean up duties but did my best. Thank you for hosting"
